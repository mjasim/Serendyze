There are no other under $50 head phones that come close to these in sound quality. Bass is solid but not over done & the rest is clear & crisp. Only complaint is they have a clasp that is used to keep them together when folded, that makes them slightly irritating as it hits your ear when used for long periods. Bottom line is, for $35, these are by far superior to anything out there.","Not bad but doesn't really block noise at all. Ear buds don't sit comfortably in my ears, so I finally bought actual headphones. These headphones have good sound quality, but they don't really rest on my head comfortably and eventually one of my ears starts to hurt because it is carrying top much of the load. For the money I would have liked more comfort and better physical noise blocking.","good product. After ~ a month of use,  I'm well pleased with the porta pro.  Sound quality is all I could ask with strong bass and wonderful clarity and presence.  I have a large head, and the headband adjustment is just adequate, and the phones do need adjustment to remain comfortable after an hour or so.  The unit appears to be of high quality and folds up easily and nicely in it's carrying case (bag).","Cheap, fragile, poor quality.. I was shocked when I got these after reading so many good reviews.  The sound is inferior, the construction is flimsy at best, and they are no where near as comfortable as they look in the pictures.  If you're looking for high quality headphones, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something of the quality that you get free on the airplane to listen to the in-flight movie, then you can get that for $5 somewhere.","These are ok but derfinitely not for those who want noise cancelling. I love the way these cans fold up and fit in my bag. The bass notes are more than adequate but the mids and highs seem to be in the background. I'm not totally satisfied with the sound quality but for the price and convenience I'm keeping it. The foam pads are quite  comfortable even after long periods of use and they allow me to still hear events happening around me.","Great sound. Not for bass junkies. Great sound. Not for bass junkies. I had beats studios before so I was a little under whelmed. But the bass is still good. A bit uncomfortable as well. Ear pads can be changed easily but sound quality will be lower.","Returned. You get what you pay for.. Despite the numerous positive reviews, I found these head-phones lacking on almost every level. The build quality seems cheap (or rather, it seems appropriate for a $20 pair of headphones), and the sound was not overly impressive. It sounded fine, but what does that really mean? The style seems cooler online, once you're holding them they just look outdated. Not retro-vintage-chic, just old.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nReturned.","Big Sound for the Buck. Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.","Best sound for low price. I've had to replace a lost pair of PortaPros and I'm glad the sound quality hasn't changed. I liked the old style straight jack compared with this L-shaped jack, but that's just personal preference and doesn't really affect anything but aesthetics. My only complaint is that I bent the adjustable metal just enough that, while not noticeable visually, it doesn't fit perfectly on my head, which is a little annoying.","Great sound for the money. I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.","Amazing product. It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).","Fantastic for the price.. I had low expectations, but this came highly recommended from an audiophile buddy, as it met very specific requirements for use at work.  I mainly use it for the gym now, since earbuds feel odd for me while running.  Lightweight, the heat\/sweat buildup is low, and not at all bothered by the sound quality.  Yeah, it clearly cant compete with a $300+ set, but its easy to brush off and still get into the music.  My only complaint is that the cable feels fragile.  Everything else feels right.","Best I've ever owned. They look old school but these things are awesome. I bought the replacement pads too but haven't had to use them yet. The sound quality is amazing and you don't lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphones.","Awesome!. This is one of the best-valued headphones on the market!\r\r\r\nHaving a clear quality sound (with good bass too!) and a miniature\r\r\r\nbuild that allows for easy transportation. The overall\r\r\r\nconstruction of the headphones seemed a bit flimsy, but the\r\r\r\nlife-time warranty helps to overlook that.\r\r\r\nIt also takes a while to get used to adjusting the size of the\r\r\r\nheadphones and placing them over your year for maximum comfort.","Want to hear everything as intended - then buy this headphone. Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!","Resonable sound quality and comfortable. I wear glasses and am very picky about over the head headphones. This one has nice design with support at the temple to relieve pressure at the ears, so doesn't push on the frame. Sound isn't bad either. I use it at office and when i go out for walks during the day and it feels comfy for extended periods of use.","Great sound... Not Great Build Quality. Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case broke on me after a year or so of use.... The cable in particular. Cheaply made cables, go with V-Moda","POOR SOUNDING. These headphones are muddy, muffled, and have very little variation between highs, lows and mid range.  Used only for listening to the news, or something where quality and clarity of sound are not of any importance.  Thumbs down.","headphones. Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy. Sound quality very good but not outstanding; sound leaks very noticeable.","Ugly but great.. Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.","Sound...AMAZING!! Lousy wire though. These are without a doubt the best sounding headphones with dazzling quality! I did my homework and read reviews whatevs...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe only problem though...Is the wire\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy headphones stopped working leaving me twisting until one or both speakers worked.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBest bang for your buck for a pair of headphones\r\r\r\nCon is the THIN WIRE...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDear Koss, if there is ANY way to strengthen the wire PLEASE let me know!!","Not Impressed At All. I am disappointed with the sound quality from this headphone. It does output strong bass, but overall sound is muffled. The high is very weak, barely audible. I prefer the Koss KSC75 and Sennhauser PX100 for they both produce a more balanced sound than the PortaPro.","Excellent sound quality. Like most of you I never listened to these prior to my purchase but read the reviews in detail. The sound quality is extremely good on my iPhone & iPads. Excellent bass, midrange & treble. Very comfortable. Happen to recently own the superb Beyerdynamic A200 p DAC\/Headphone Amp which really turns these headphones to amazing quality sound, but they are still excellent without this.\r\r\r\nIn my opinion these could sell for $200 & still be a good value if you like quality sound from an iPhone.","Muffled, Muddy, Distorted. Positives:\r\r\r\nComfortable, produce deep base.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNegatives:\r\r\r\nMuffled, muddy, much distortion.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe cord appears to be made of cheap material; inflexible. Based on the lack of sound quality, an appropriate price would be less than $10. The set sent to me really sounded cheap. I tried many types of music files on several playback devices. Maybe they are defective.","Needs stronger cords, sounds great. Sound quality is great for over the ear headphones, but the cord quality does not stand up. The wires are really thin and be sure not to snag them on anything or they will rip right out. I lost my left cord to a very feeble tree branch.","Retro goodness - Premium Sound. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate. Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones. The sound quality is far above what you expect. I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones. Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned for wearing with glasses.","Piece of Junk!. Fell apart in days. One side broke off with normal use. Sound quality not that good. Cheaply made.","I'm old enough to remember when these came out. Still rockin'. Still excellent sound quality. Love these classic headphones. Really warm toned and well-rounded. If you are hating those tinny-sounding earbuds that make your ears itch, and want a rich smoothness to your jam, try these. For the price, there is not a better sounding portable headphone- ask any audio engineer or sound professional.","A company with great customer service. I'm no audiophlie, but the sound quality from these open-ear headphones is great for the money. As is the case with any open-ear headphone, there is a lot of sound leakage--so it's not amenable for places where you need to be quiet.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBe forewarned though, that the thin and sharp metal headband might cause discomfort if the fit is bad.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter about six months of rough usage, the plastic clips that hold the two phones together, on the metal headband, snapped. From what I've heard, Koss is great about warranty (and sometimes, even out-of-warranty) replacements.","Awful headphones, low quality, but most importantly, sound quality is terrible, piercing, and uncomfortable.. The sound quality on these are AWFUL.  I'm sorry, I can't recommend this to anyone no matter how cheap it is.  There's very little bass, and any loudness in the headphone sounds piercing and awful.","Impressed. I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.","Fine sound quality, but not comfortable.. I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable. They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.","Koss Porta pro. Four star sound quality for under $50. Very comfortable, with solid construction. The review on cnet.com is spot on. I could not be more pleased with this purchase.","Great shape, lightweight, good sound.. Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.\r\r\r\nI love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!","Airplane headphones?. Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.","Just what I'd hoped for. There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable\/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.","The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use. The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use; between my phone and laptop, the tip of the smaller cord jack broke off, inside my phone.","budget headphone best bang for buck!. I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.","The sound is simply the best. Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews?  Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.","The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. They are painful to wear, however. And the foam cushions don't last long.","Doesn't give you nice bass\/sound quality compared to more expensive headsets that cover .... Very compact. Doesn't give you nice bass\/sound quality compared to more expensive headsets that cover your entire ear, but I use it when I go for bike rides, train rides, etc and it works perfectly. My friend and I both bought ours around Christmas time. He told me his broke, but I have yet to break mine.","headphones. I just received these headphones and could not believe the sound quality for an item at this price. Treat yourself and pick up a pair.","5 STAR. Have had these for years now.  Best ever!  Sound quality is fantastic, great bass and highs.  Ear pads are inexpensive and easy to replace.  Fit is great even after years of use. No cons.","Would recommend this product. Bought these for my daughter and she loves them very much and the pouch that came with it is very handy. Would recommend this product. The sound quality is really good and they are comforatable for many hours of use.","Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are .... Bought my first pair in 1991 and they still work after going through 4 though years of grad school and then being at work since then on a daily basis. Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are not noise canceling at all.  Great quality sound, very comfortable as I have worn them for 10 or more hours straight multiple nights back in school.","Excellent sound, superb comfort, lacking low-end bass.. Not a bad pair of headphones at all. Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.","Good Product. Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price","It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones.. It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones. Just not as good sounds as I thought, or maybe I just played crappy music with lousy mp3 quality, downloaded from unreliable source. I confused.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut the good thing is, I can bring it to airplane and don't have to use that even crappier headphones from airlines! yeay!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt's not as pretty as it look from the picture though, I think that Beats by dr. Dre look more sturdier than this.","GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!","Underwhelmed.... Read all the reviews before buying it and had expected more.  But in reality I really should not have since I didn't pay too much for it.  The main thing that really dislike about it is that the collapsing mechanism isn't stiff enough and I find I have to make sure I'm putting it on with both hands or else the headphones will fold in.  Other than that I think it is okay.  I'm not much of an audiophile so I'll leave the sound quality and what not to those in the know.","Unlucky I Guess. Guess I drew the short straw on this product. Package arrived on time,Packaging was sufficient,But straight out of the headphone package and plugged into my ipod, I discovered that the left earphone speaker made a crackling noise. All of my other headphones sound just fine plugged into the same player. I have used other products from this manufacturer over the years,and never had a problem till now. I think this issue would probably fall under the lack of quality control category.","Good sound quality, poor construction. good sound! But very chintzy material and construction. It's going back.","Either love it or hate it. Classic for a reason. Great sound, great looks (imo) and sturdy construction. Love that it comes with a leather carrying case. Koss has been in the game for a long time. A quick search of this headphone on any respected audio\/video forum will reveal largely positive reviews for excellent sound quality compared to the price point.","these aren't very comfortable, especially for a bald dude like myself. You simply can't argue with a lifetime warranty.  And the sound quality has never let me down.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, these aren't very comfortable, especially for a bald dude like myself.  These only fit well when the headband is fully deployed, and it invariably ends of pinching the short hairs off my head (not painfully, thankfully).","Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.","Great Headphones. Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.","Good sound but not the quality build of years gone by. I had a pair of these in the 90s which had a stellar build, excellent audio quality, and lasted for years and years with hard use. I purchased this pair in 2014.  The audio quality is good.  Unfortunately, the build quality is not great.  I've given this pair moderate use, and the black ear cup lining is falling off -- exposing loose foam that won't last.","Great sound, super comfortable.. Great sound quality, almost up to the standard of my huge over-ear studio headphones. Lightweight and comfortable for a full day of use. If these came in Bluetooth, I'd marry them.","Overrated.. OK sound quality, and not very comfortable for my midget-sized head. Based on the reviews I was hoping for better, but it's adequate for most people. The ear buds that came with my phone have better bass expression.","prefer Sportapro. I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.","They're acceptable.. They're pretty comfortable, and the sound quality is not bad, except for what sounds to my ears like an exaggerated, slightly muddy bass. I'm one of those guys that likes natural, uncolored sound reproduction.","These sound really, really good.... ... and feel really, really fragile. Compared to my 200$ fidelio l1s, these sound fairly similar, in terms of sound signature, but (obviously) a completely different build. These are very smooth and clear, with no siblence, but they aren't incredibly detailed. I would listen to Lymbyc System's \"Narita\" for a highlight of everything these do right, and for what they do wrong \"Fly By Wire\" by S.S.L.Y.B.Y. has a different effect..\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nStats: (compared to Sennhieser and Phillips headphones)\r\r\r\nComfort: 5\/10\r\r\r\nSound Quality: 8\/10\r\r\r\nBuild Quality: 4\/10 (with a lifetime warranty)\r\r\r\nStyle: 7\/10\r\r\r\nPortability: 9\/10","Good quality in a small package.. These headphones have been the companion to my laptop since the day I bought them. They are small, light, and deliver surprisingly good sound for the size.\r\r\r\nOn the negative size, the foam ear pads can fall off very easily, and have a relatively short life. The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.","Great. The sound quality is absolutely amazing; they are lightweight and suitable for walking\/hiking.  The only downside is they cannot survive rough treatment so as long as you take delicate care of them, they are a great choice at a reasonable price.","Great headphones. Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.","not great. i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere."]},{"ngram":"great sound","count":104,"ngram_comments":["Great sound for the money.. Great sound for the money.  Rich, full bass and clear highs without being piercing.","Great for the price. For what these cost they do what they do well. They're very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the ear-piece adjustment. As far as sound goes, I haven't had any complaints. They sound much better than similarly priced headphones that I've owned, and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and about.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound leaks of course, but you could tell that from the image.

Very comfortable to wear and does not hurt my ears.\r\r\r\nI listen to the Beatles and other sorts of Rock Music and these headphones play em well. Accurate detailed sound with a good mid range. Bass response is punchy but limited\r\r\r\nNot recommended for Hip Hop or bass heavy Techno, I mean why would you anyways?","I have truly enjoyed this headphone set. I have truly enjoyed this headphone set. It creates great sound, but is hard to put in place, and is easily disturbed.","the sound is great as is the portability. This is my second pair and for the price, the sound is great as is the portability.","Great sound. Not for bass junkies. Great sound. Not for bass junkies. I had beats studios before so I was a little under whelmed. But the bass is still good. A bit uncomfortable as well. Ear pads can be changed easily but sound quality will be lower.","Good sound, great grantee, great price.. Good high, Good bass, good sound in general. Great guarantee, great price. Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds, like for jogging.","Best headphones I've owned!. Recommended by CNET, these headphones are light, portable, and have the best sound I've heard in this price range.\r\r\r\nI originally bought them for a laptop, and now I use them on every audio device I own. Great product, excellent price.","Great sound for the money. I have owned these for two years now, and use them almost every day.  They are light, comfortable, and easy to carry in my bag.  I have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them.  The sound quality if very good for the price, and in fact, better than some that cost two or three times as much - as I have discovered to my regret!  I highly recommend these.","Koss PortaPro Headphones. Very happy with the headphones. Not as small as I would have thought. They do function and sound great. The adjustablity is a little sloppy and needs to be redone every time you put them on.\r\r\r\nAmazon was great to deal with as usual!","Sound Great. I like to plug these into my Samsung Tab. These were a gift from my wife and I'm sure glad she got these for me. They put out more sound than my old junky headphones and they fold into a compact soft case. I love them!","great headphones for the money!. these are great headphones for the money!\r\r\r\nThey are pretty neutral sounding and they fit comfortably.","Amazing product. It has an amazing bass and great sound quality, adding a great price you get an amazing product (the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big head).","Great, with some issues. Heres the skinny,\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros: Great sound!\r\r\r\n  I love the vintage look.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons: They don't stay on your head very well.\r\r\r\n  The metal band is annoying\r\r\r\n  the comfortZone feature is nice but doesn't lock, I had to keep switching it back every 10 min.\r\r\r\n  Also the cord is pretty short for earphones.\r\r\r\nhonestly I like these, I just wish they'd fix these minor inconviences.","Nice but.... I find them comfortable enough. They are also small and light. They do sound fine to me, but I am not a great judge of that anymore. However, there is one annoying thing, the short cord. I am sure that's all in the eyes of the beholder, but that's how I feel.","Nice for price. Has great sound, it only goes on one way and have to reset the fitting by pulling down each time but I like'em.","Great sound, affordable. Great sound for the price and seem like they will last for a while.  A good value for the price as well.","Nice sound, little cost.. Great sound for little money. Nice smooth bass with decent highs. Replaceable ears cushions.","Great value for the price. Super portable and the sound is remarkably good for such an inexpensive set of headphones. I like the retro styling and find them to be quite comfortable, particularly over glasses, compared to other over the ear headphones.","Want to hear everything as intended - then buy this headphone. Yep, it's old style that is back in-style!  These are the best sound quality reproduction, lightest, easy on the ears headphones I have ever purchased.  Great for the laptop, MP3 player, stereo system or your TV.  Koss has not changed a thing in over what 30 years I think and now I know why.  They work great!  Check this out.. my 17 y.o. was shocked at the quality he didn't want to give them back to me. haha!","Five Stars. They have great sound. and fold up nicely. thanks","Nice sound. The headphones have great sound for the price!  Only problem is that I recently shaved my head bald, and it's now somewhat annoying having the sharp metal band and plastic brackets digging in to the top of my head, but it's not a problem for most people, I'm sure.  Other than that, I'm very happy and would recommend them to anyone.  They're durable as well - they took a trip to Thailand and back with me, completely unharmed (I live in the US).","A classic since 1984. Very good pair of headphones. While not exactly stylish(introduced in 1984),style does`t matter much when you have them on and listen to your music. Very clear,warm,bassy. Frequency response is 15-25000 Hz,impedance 60ohms,101 dB sound pressure level,4ft cord,carry case included. These are great for travel and working out. Their direct competition are Sennheiser PX100-II.Both are highly regarded by audiophiles.","Great Headphones. I purchased these head phones for my grandson to used with his new Elec. Piano and\r\r\r\nhe really likes them. The sound is clear and chrisp. We were very happy with the\r\r\r\nservice we recieved for this order.","durability?. I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.","great sound. This is the 4th pair of these headphones. THE CONNECTOR PROBLEM has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat. The 6nit curls up into easily transported ball. I can, t imagine flying withojt them.","i've been finding that these headphones don't have the greatest life expectency. one of the ears shorted out, i've been finding that these headphones don't have the greatest life expectency.\r\r\r\nthey sound great though, and I could probably warrenty them, but i can't be assed.","Great sound... Not Great Build Quality. Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case broke on me after a year or so of use.... The cable in particular. Cheaply made cables, go with V-Moda","Nice Sound. Great phones. Wire gets tangles sometimes but other than that, great sound.","Ugly but great.. Great sound, time proven stats and abilities. Check out reviews elsewhere, I did, these are the best quality for the price.","Sounds great, one small design problem. I bought these after Shure jacked up the price of their mini headphone from $30 to $90 (huh?).  Anyway, these sound just fine and are comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is how each side of the head band is connected together, that if I adjust it while on my head, my hair can get caught under the band.  Yoowwwzaaaa!  I don't have long hair, so I would imagine it would be even worse for those people.","Great Old School Headphone at a great old school price. Sound is. Great.\r\r\r\nPrice is great.\r\r\r\nA little fragile, but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full sound.","GREAT SOUND. YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT.  I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT, I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE, I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE. AND WHEN THE FOAM PADDING WEARS OUT, YOU CAN REPLACE THEM, WHICH YOU CAN NOT ON THE EXPENSIVE ONES, YOU CAN GET THE FOAM PADS THROUGH AMAZON ALSO","Good enough for a non-audiophile. I love the retro look. For my big head, they don't fit ideally and the adjustments aren't that helpful.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut they sound great, they fold up easily, and they have a lifelong warranty that I hope to never use.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe sound isolation isn't that impressive but aside from that, these are great headphones.","Small size, big sound!. They fold up very small however the pouch is slightly to small and had to cram them in eventhough I made them as small as possible.  The great part is the fantastic sound they produce.","Great sounding, but add some color to music. Great sounding, but these do add some coloration to the playback.  Perhaps they need more break-in time.  Other than that, these have excellent clear sound and bass.  Headphones or speakers should be completely neutral.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut I still give them 5 star.  For less money try Panasoinc RP-HT21 lightweights.","My Second Pair!. I bought a pair of these headphones years ago and finally wore out one of the wires.  I was so glad to find them again.  They produce such great sound!!","Great heaset sound at a tiny price.. Outstanding bass while keeping everything else clean, at an incredible low price; and confortable !","Great Sounding but Ugly. You'd be hard pressed to find better sounding headphones for the price.  However, the 30-year old retro design might make you be hesitant to listen to that great sound in public!  If you can get past the looks, you'll certainly be pleased with these headphones.  Don't be surprised if they blow off the doors of your trendy looking Beats headphones!  Also, you are covered by the Koss no-questions-asked lifetime warranty.  The one-star deduction is only due to the aesthetics.","Lightweight, compact and portable.  Not much else.. Lightweight but not as comfortable as those with more ear padding.  Good sound.  Not great.  Better than in-ear phones.","OK for the price. Sounds good, but not great.  Will do the job.  Would not recommend for music. what else can I say about them?","Sounds pretty great. Was using Sony PQs (bought on a whim). I'd say these are a step up, and actually costed less. Also, they are not over-ear like the Sonys, yet still sound better. Much more comfortable and lightweight as well. Got them about a month ago and have been using them daily since, no issues thus far.","Great value. These headphones sound great and the price can't be beat.  I use them frequently.  I did not give them 5 stars because they can get a bit uncomfortable after extended use (2+ hours) and they do very little to block the sound from being heard by anyone close by.","great headset. This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.","Needs stronger cords, sounds great. Sound quality is great for over the ear headphones, but the cord quality does not stand up. The wires are really thin and be sure not to snag them on anything or they will rip right out. I lost my left cord to a very feeble tree branch.","Great value!. These sound really good for an inexpensive pair of headphones. Nice bass for the money.","Good Headphones, Great for price. The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.","A company with great customer service. I'm no audiophlie, but the sound quality from these open-ear headphones is great for the money. As is the case with any open-ear headphone, there is a lot of sound leakage--so it's not amenable for places where you need to be quiet.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBe forewarned though, that the thin and sharp metal headband might cause discomfort if the fit is bad.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter about six months of rough usage, the plastic clips that hold the two phones together, on the metal headband, snapped. From what I've heard, Koss is great about warranty (and sometimes, even out-of-warranty) replacements.","Worth every penny!. There are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours, so I will only mention a few points:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n1) I had the Sportapros. They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are worth every penny!","Great shape, lightweight, good sound.. Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.\r\r\r\nI love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!","Airplane headphones?. Seriously, are these airplane headphones?  That's how poor I found the sound quality in these.  I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself, wow, what a let down.  They do look cool but even the $5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these.  I cannot believe this is Koss, I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad.","great sound. these headphones sound great better than a lot that cost 3 or 4 times as much","The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use. The sound quality was great; but after only a few weeks of use; between my phone and laptop, the tip of the smaller cord jack broke off, inside my phone.","cant beat the sound. the sound is great, the fit is great, but the cushions are wearing off after while...well guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and tear","Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.","Great headphones; Not for office listening!. Very comfortable and a great sound.  I am docking one star because these things bleed sound like crazy.  My co-worker over heard me listening to Party in the USA and as a 23 year old man that was a difficult one to explain my way out of.","unbelievable lightweight headphones. There is a reason why this headphone has had such a following, and is still going strong after decades of production. Had my first set many years ago, and recently re-discovered why........ Great sound from such a small lightweight 'phone. Listening is believing - deep bass, clear highs.....What more could one ask?","Great set of headphones. My husband laughed when I bought these because he said when he was younger this was the brand that he and his friends laughed at. But he has since recanted his feelings towards this brand and still use these great little headphones. They came in a travel bag and the sound is really quite awesome.","fit not great and lost of sound escaping to disturb others. Koss went cheap on this one. Flimsy, fit not great and lost of sound escaping to disturb others.","budget headphone best bang for buck!. I have this for 3 years now and I still use it for my everyday use. It is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones. Too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymore.","Great sound. Bad design. Alrighty this headphone is so good at producing very accurate sound considering its price. There is one design flaw and it was very prominently let it down for me. The steel bars will snatch your hair while adjusting or placing the phone over your head. Also the cables are weak and broke for me. Now I upgraded to M50 and feel so much better","A great vaule. Great sound for the $.  Comfortable for my big head.  Design is a little clunky in and out of the included vinyl pouch.","What a Great Buy. Great Sound for the price! While it may look retro, the sound it creates can't be beat for the price you pay.","Great Headphones. I saw these retro headphones and thought no way. After I read the review by CNET and others I decided to give them a try. Glad i did becasue they are great. They are light, comfortable for long use, adjustable and the sound is really good.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n* it is true that they may pull out a hair or two at the top of the slider at your head.","5 STAR. Have had these for years now.  Best ever!  Sound quality is fantastic, great bass and highs.  Ear pads are inexpensive and easy to replace.  Fit is great even after years of use. No cons.","Pretty good.. These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPROS\r\r\r\n- Sound is great, bass and all.\r\r\r\n- iPod\/iPhone friendly plug.\r\r\r\n- Lightweight and comfortable.\r\r\r\n- The price is right.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONS\r\r\r\n- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.\r\r\r\n- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.","Three Stars. Sound was great, but the style is not really into me; had to return it","Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are .... Bought my first pair in 1991 and they still work after going through 4 though years of grad school and then being at work since then on a daily basis. Great headphones. Block out most outside noise but are not noise canceling at all.  Great quality sound, very comfortable as I have worn them for 10 or more hours straight multiple nights back in school.","Great headphone under $100. Who woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under $100 would be a portable version?","Great, cheap headphones.. Yep. An old classic. No styling changes for 20-plus years. But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!","GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!","Not a huge fan, jack broke in first month.. I bought them through a relative's recommendation. They sound great with classical and vocals, but the isolation is nonexistant so they are not the best options if you want to listen on a bus.","The best! for mobile activities like the gym these are .... The best! for mobile activities like the gym these are great for me. I can't take the inner ear type ear buds my ears are just too sensitive.\r\r\r\nThese sound fantastic!","Fragile. Great sound but... they broke on me. :( They're pretty fragile for something billed as portable. However, I am about to order them again because they're so darn cheap for the sound. Still I'm really disappointed they broke so fast.","Koss PortaPro sounds very good and a great value. Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.","Great Buy for Portable Headphone. For the price one of the best portable Headphones I have owned.  Great sound and light weight","Either love it or hate it. Classic for a reason. Great sound, great looks (imo) and sturdy construction. Love that it comes with a leather carrying case. Koss has been in the game for a long time. A quick search of this headphone on any respected audio\/video forum will reveal largely positive reviews for excellent sound quality compared to the price point.","Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.","Very good phones. I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.","Great sound for the price. Great sound for the price. They have a very expansive and detailed sound with plenty of bass for such small drivers. They're super light but can be uncomfortable based on the locking mechanism on the earpad swivel. Some people also complain about their hair getting caught in the headband. If you don't like in-ear headphones and want something for traveling without any outside noise-blocking, these would be a great choice, IMO.","Great Headphones. Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.","Great headphones. I love these headphones. This is the second pair I've purchased (I wanted another pair for the office). I've used the first pair for years. The sound is very good - not artificially heavy on bass. I use them to listen to music in iTunes and Pandora. They are also comfortable to wear. If I could change one thing, I'd change the heavy coiled cable for something lighter.","Good for music and editing. Love 'em! They travel well, in spite of their size relative to earbuds. They fold up and go in a carry-on bag with no problems. They have great sound. I bought them for music and audio editing.","It does not effect me and the sound is absolutely great.. Originally purchased for my wife, who cannot wear it because of a strange little bent piece of metal near the earpiece.  It does not effect me and the sound is absolutely great.","Good sound but not the quality build of years gone by. I had a pair of these in the 90s which had a stellar build, excellent audio quality, and lasted for years and years with hard use. I purchased this pair in 2014.  The audio quality is good.  Unfortunately, the build quality is not great.  I've given this pair moderate use, and the black ear cup lining is falling off -- exposing loose foam that won't last.","Portability and Easy Listening. Pros:\r\r\r\n- Sound is decent for its price\r\r\r\n- Very compact when folded and placed in case; great for traveling.\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n- No noise cancellation\r\r\r\n- When adjusting, band gets separated causing hair to get stuck in the band; quite painful.\r\r\r\nNotes:\r\r\r\n- To adjust without worrying about hair, it's best to adjust it to the maximum length and then place it on your head and push the sides of the metal bands together until it fits.","Love them. Sound great and compete with more expensive .... Third pair of these. Love them. Sound great and compete with more expensive phones like Grado","Three Stars.

Great sound quality, almost up to the standard of my huge over-ear studio headphones. Lightweight and comfortable for a full day of use. If these came in Bluetooth, I'd marry them.","Greatest portable headphones under $100. Best portable headphones for under $50, maybe even $100. Had Koss headphone ear clips (ksc 55?) back in 2000 when they tried to get into the urban streetstyle market. I remember those headphones being great sounding, just a bad heavy design for clips.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese here are the best. Sounds great and natural. Staging is good. And are incredibly comfortable. If your looking exaggerated bass response, THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU.","Great sound for an inexpensive set of headphones. Everything the the other reviewers said seems to be true.  Much, much better sound and more comfortable than the \"standard ear-buds\".  I flew 10 hours back to the US from Germany, after watching 4 movies, they are immensely comfortable.  They do catch your hair when removing or adjusting them.  Very nice sound for an under $30 set of headphones.  The lifetime warranty was the final clincher for me.","Great value, good sound, no isolation.. Very good value. Strong bass, good high response, warmish sound. Absolutely no isolation. Because of this, it does leak a bit, but it's not very noticable from more than a foot \/ 1\/3 meter away unless you like to crank the volume.","great pair of foldable headphones. i already have a set and this was a purchase for my wife. great headphones for the price. they fold and store, have deep clear sound and have a lifetime warranty. my other set got a frayed cord, so for $7 i sent them back and koss replaced them with the newer version! an excellent value for the money. i use them with an ipod and an ipod shuffle and they do the job really well.","Tasty. Smaller & lighter than you think for over\/the\/ear phones. Breaks down to a compact package travel. Great full spectrum stereo sound and really good bass response.","Great sound for price range. Awesome sound, especially at this price range.  I didn't want to pay more than $30-40 for headphones, but these were a significant upgrade in sound from my previous (cheaper) pair.  Only downside is that the metal band has a sharp corner that sometime bothers my ear.","Great. The sound quality is absolutely amazing; they are lightweight and suitable for walking\/hiking.  The only downside is they cannot survive rough treatment so as long as you take delicate care of them, they are a great choice at a reasonable price.","Awesome sound.  Cool fit.  Folds up nicely.. These have become my go to headphones when I can avoid earbuds.  I travel and they fold up nice in small in their little bag.  They have a stylish, retro fit to them as well.  I compared them to my full size Grado open back headphones and they are almost on par.  Since they have a much smaller cord they are convenient for wearing on the move.  You can also hear everything going on around you with out sacrificing great sound.","Great headphones. Excellent product in every way.  This product is light, easy to use, comfortable and excellent sound quality.  All in all worth the money.","Newfound love of overear Headphones.. I hate overear headphones but these I love. They are better than any earbuds and headphones I've ever had. They have great sound and are in my opinion quite durable. Well worth my money I am very pleased with this one.","not great. i bought these over a year ago hoping that a company offering a lifetime warranty would provide a product that would last; i'm on my third pair. when they work, they are ok, but every 6 months the sound quality becomes so painfully bad i send them back. i suggest throwing your money elsewhere."]},{"ngram":"good sound","count":93,"ngram_comments":["Not bad but doesn't really block noise at all.

For the money I would have liked more comfort and better physical noise blocking.","good product. After ~ a month of use,  I'm well pleased with the porta pro.  Sound quality is all I could ask with strong bass and wonderful clarity and presence.  I have a large head, and the headband adjustment is just adequate, and the phones do need adjustment to remain comfortable after an hour or so.  The unit appears to be of high quality and folds up easily and nicely in it's carrying case (bag).","they sound great, for about a month. Broke just four days after the return window closed. Good design!","Cheap, fragile, poor quality.. I was shocked when I got these after reading so many good reviews.  The sound is inferior, the construction is flimsy at best, and they are no where near as comfortable as they look in the pictures.  If you're looking for high quality headphones, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for something of the quality that you get free on the airplane to listen to the in-flight movie, then you can get that for $5 somewhere.","True Value. Product arrived as scheduled and nicely packaged. Had my doubts with the Koss brand as I never believed it was a premier brand. The sound is very nice and balanced. Good bass and not overwhelming. The design is a little outdated but I grew up in the 80's so it is fine with me. In fact used the headphones to watch one of the cult classics, Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Amazon Instant Video. Good bang for your buck and definitely a true value.","Best Over the Ear Head Phones. Best over the ear headphones at this price range.

Good sound, but the spiral cord broke in three places internally after limited use. Cost to repair is near the cost to buy other brand. Wasted $94 on these. Recommend Sennheiser or Audio Technica at about $99.","Great sound. Not for bass junkies. Great sound. Not for bass junkies. I had beats studios before so I was a little under whelmed.

Good high, Good bass, good sound in general. Great guarantee, great price. Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds, like for jogging.","Big Sound for the Buck. Title of this review pretty much sums it up. The bass is a bit too heavy, for my liking. However, the overall quality is very good.  My son took a listen and he loved them.  He and his sister have a birthday coming up, so I think I will pick up a couple pair. Good value for the money.","Great sound for the money.

Decent, clean sound.  The offset design has advantages and disadvantages.  They fold up all right, but seem to spring back to a pre-set width so you can adjust and leave them in one position.  Not disappointed and the price is pretty good.","Great sound, affordable. Great sound for the price and seem like they will last for a while.  A good value for the price as well.","Awesome!. This is one of the best-valued headphones on the market!\r\r\r\nHaving a clear quality sound (with good bass too!) and a miniature\r\r\r\nbuild that allows for easy transportation. The overall\r\r\r\nconstruction of the headphones seemed a bit flimsy, but the\r\r\r\nlife-time warranty helps to overlook that.\r\r\r\nIt also takes a while to get used to adjusting the size of the\r\r\r\nheadphones and placing them over your year for maximum comfort.","Great value for the price. Super portable and the sound is remarkably good for such an inexpensive set of headphones. I like the retro styling and find them to be quite comfortable, particularly over glasses, compared to other over the ear headphones.","Koss PortaPro. For the price it sells it's not worth it, even you can fold them, and they have a good bass sound.\r\r\r\nI decided to keep it, but would not reccommend it unless the price is $ 10.\r\r\r\nPurchased different Koss model, much happier now, keeping both pairs.","not comfortable. the sound is pretty good on these but they are really uncomfortable on my head.  I have lots of unruly hair and it get stuck in it.","Good headphone for the $ if you can stand its appearance.. Classic headphone has pretty good sound, with pretty strong bass, surprising for an on-ear design with no seal against the ear. Looks dorky, a tad too much pressure against my head, and I'd like more treble. But then I've got a large head, and some high-freq hearing loss, so ymmv.","Quite good, but the MDR7506 is much better. I got both these, and the similar MDR7506 as well. Contrary to what many reviewers state, these do not not sound quite the same as the MDR7506, which are way much better. Yes, there is a price difference between the two, but I strongly recommend getting the MDR7506 when in doubt.","They've been making these since 1984 which is all you need to know. I've had mine for years. They sounded good in the 1980's and they sound just as good today.  Plus they come with a 100% iron clad no questions asked lifetime warranty which I had to use when the cord simply wore out back in 2002.  I got my new ones within a week.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSure they look like something out of Star Trek, but the sound is fabulous and they are very comfortable and for under $50, I don't see how you can beat them.","Best price\/value headphones I ever had.. That's about it, really honest headphones, cheap and the sound is quite balanced. Headband pressure adjustable (firm \/ light). I find the firm a bit too tight but it's a good setting when being active. Totally recommend.","A classic since 1984. Very good pair of headphones. While not exactly stylish(introduced in 1984),style does`t matter much when you have them on and listen to your music. Very clear,warm,bassy. Frequency response is 15-25000 Hz,impedance 60ohms,101 dB sound pressure level,4ft cord,carry case included. These are great for travel and working out. Their direct competition are Sennheiser PX100-II.Both are highly regarded by audiophiles.","Excellent sound for a portable headphone. Incredible sound for the size and price, really deep clear bass. I previously had some Skullcandy Lowriders and they didn't sound as good and the plastic headband broke in half, the metal band on these Koss headphones should stand up better to minor daily abuse. The only complaint I have is that you have to re adjust them after every use and since there is no padding on the top the metal band snags my long hair.","durability?. I've had these for a while, haven't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD. Okay to good sound, but the durability isn't great --- one of the ear pieces constantly comes off. It can be re-placed, but it's a nuisance.","headphones. Fit only so-so, pressure adjustment flimsy. Sound quality very good but not outstanding; sound leaks very noticeable.","Good. I regret the purchase because of how they look. Also the wires are very thin, I'm afraid of damaging them. But the sound is undeniably good.","Best Headphones under $75. Very good, open sounds-stage. Very sturdy, contrary to what it may look like. I love the style. Extremely comfortable.","Lifetime Warranty and Made in U.S.A.. I've had these for years and they just keep going.  They are light, sound pretty good, fold up very small, and are kind of funky looking.  You can tell that these were designed in the 1980's, but who's going to steal something this ugly?  If they ever malfunction, Koss will repair or replace them, but that hasn't been needed so far.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI don't use them for home use, but for my mp3 player.","These used to be made better. I had a pair of these and broke them then sent for another pair,the replacement pair was not made the same and don't sound as good as my old pair,these are made more cheaply by far and are not near as good as there old model","Excellent sound. For a good price.. Excellent sound. For a good price.","GREAT SOUND. YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT.  I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT, I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE, I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE. AND WHEN THE FOAM PADDING WEARS OUT, YOU CAN REPLACE THEM, WHICH YOU CAN NOT ON THE EXPENSIVE ONES, YOU CAN GET THE FOAM PADS THROUGH AMAZON ALSO","Everyone around you can hear them. These headphones have a lot of sound leak. Other people around me can hear it very easily. It's not good for home in bed, on the couch next to someone, or at the office. I wasn't expecting noise cancellation, but I was expecting something quieter. Otherwise, why am I buying headphones?","Good enough for a non-audiophile. I love the retro look. For my big head, they don't fit ideally and the adjustments aren't that helpful.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut they sound great, they fold up easily, and they have a lifelong warranty that I hope to never use.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe sound isolation isn't that impressive but aside from that, these are great headphones.","Among the very best. Some of the very best headphones made. Excellent sound and very good external noise rejection, without the use of electronics.","Lightweight, compact and portable.  Not much else.. Lightweight but not as comfortable as those with more ear padding.  Good sound.  Not great.  Better than in-ear phones.","very nice. these have very good sound.  relatively comfortable on head.  I like being able to hear surrounding sounds, so I appreciate that.","kooky. i bought these because they looked kooky.  they sound good and they're foldable but they're not as comfy as i imagined.  they hurt after an hour or so.","Amazing full range Rich Sound for your Ears. Amazing full range Rich Sound for your Ears !\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nVery Unique set of headphones. I have several good cans I kept out of many I tried over the years.\r\r\r\nThis set is one of my top favorites.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n... Give yourself a gift and buy it.","Sounds really good, e specially at the price range. Sounds really good,e specially at the price range. Very good value.","OK for the price. Sounds good, but not great.  Will do the job.  Would not recommend for music. what else can I say about them?","Excellent sound quality. Like most of you I never listened to these prior to my purchase but read the reviews in detail. The sound quality is extremely good on my iPhone & iPads. Excellent bass, midrange & treble. Very comfortable. Happen to recently own the superb Beyerdynamic A200 p DAC\/Headphone Amp which really turns these headphones to amazing quality sound, but they are still excellent without this.\r\r\r\nIn my opinion these could sell for $200 & still be a good value if you like quality sound from an iPhone.","great headset. This is my favorite headset to use around the house. Pros: Light weight, collapsible, adjustable band, good sound, comfortable to wear. (i get tired of using my in-ear phones). It is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundings.","Retro goodness - Premium Sound. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate. Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones. The sound quality is far above what you expect. I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones. Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned for wearing with glasses.","Great value!. These sound really good for an inexpensive pair of headphones. Nice bass for the money.","Piece of Junk!. Fell apart in days. One side broke off with normal use. Sound quality not that good. Cheaply made.","Ugly but good sound. Truly an ugly duckling of a head set. It feels flimsy, and my hair gets caught now and then. But the sound is crisp, tight with solid bass response. That adds one more start to what would be a 3 star rating.","No good for the long haul.... Sound is good overall but these don't wear well.  Miniplug connector shorts out and earpads keep popping out of their cheap plastic plates.","Good Headphones, Great for price. The headphones work quite well.  They don't feel like great headphones but they have held up pretty well and produce good sound.  I use them on the treadmill as I don't like in ear headphones and they have held up well considering all of the sweat that has gone into them.","Koss. Nice sound.  Still a little bulky to carry but light weight.  Sound was very good. It would have been nice if there was a microphone to use with my iPhone.","Impressed. I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.","Three Stars. Sounds good but getting hair stuck on it is quite annoying :(","Good and Bad. So it folds up.  That's nice.  It sounds pretty good.  That's also nice.  But it also feels pretty cheaply built and the connector is not at a right angle so I'm expecting that the wire will begin to break near there from all the bending.","Fine sound quality, but not comfortable.. I got these because the low price, good sound quality and they are collapsable. They do all those, they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable. They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time. I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust.","Not bad.... Good sound, light weight, ... one of two black head band plastic  retainers fell off.  never was able to find it or an address for a replacement part.","Great shape, lightweight, good sound.. Great shape, lightweight, good sound for inexpensive price.\r\r\r\nI love hearing bass, high notes, low notes, without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out - never happens with these headphones.  Quality, easy to wear, they don't give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears won't hurt!","cheaply made, easily broken. skip this product. The ear piece came off the product. The item is cheaply made and broke after 5 total uses while I was exercising. The ear piece can snap back in place but then fall out within a minute. HORRIBLE! The sound is pretty good for the price point, but definitely as good as the sennheiser px100 that some guy wrote about. I had those headphones and the are far the best sub $80 headphones I have ever used. I'm going to be ordering those on Cyber Monday. I returned these cheap pieces of crap.","Little phones...big sound. For the price, these little phones are really good.  Perfect for small stuff, when big or more expense headphones just won't fit.","Just what I'd hoped for. There's not much I can add to what's already been said about the Koss PortaPro headphones. These have got to be one of the best values out there today. Sound is phenomenal. Comfort (for me) is very good. The only area for concern that I could see was the quality of the cable\/jack. I added two layers of shrink tubing at this junction to relieve stress. I think that will be sufficient. Highly recommend this product.","Four Stars. these are comfy and sound pretty good. Would have 5 stars if the cord was detachable.","Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.","Great sound. Bad design. Alrighty this headphone is so good at producing very accurate sound considering its price. There is one design flaw and it was very prominently let it down for me. The steel bars will snatch your hair while adjusting or placing the phone over your head. Also the cables are weak and broke for me. Now I upgraded to M50 and feel so much better","Nothing beats Koss for good sound on a small budget. Nothing beats Koss for good sound on a small budget. This model, however, is flimsy. Without the mic, 5 starts.","Bad wires. The cords always seemed stiff.  The wires broke inside the cords at the strain relief after six months.  Almost any removal of the phones causes them to reset to the tightest fitting.  Good sound, but generally poor design.","The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. The sound quality is pretty good. Better than my Urban Ears. They are painful to wear, however. And the foam cushions don't last long.","Great Headphones. I saw these retro headphones and thought no way. After I read the review by CNET and others I decided to give them a try. Glad i did becasue they are great. They are light, comfortable for long use, adjustable and the sound is really good.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n* it is true that they may pull out a hair or two at the top of the slider at your head.","Pretty good.. These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPROS\r\r\r\n- Sound is great, bass and all.\r\r\r\n- iPod\/iPhone friendly plug.\r\r\r\n- Lightweight and comfortable.\r\r\r\n- The price is right.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONS\r\r\r\n- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.\r\r\r\n- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.","They Really Are Good. I'm a pretty discerning audiophile, and I would say that the reviews of these headphones are justified.  Using them with an IPod they were very musical and detailed, without an overhyped or overemphasized sound (ie exaggerated bass or dry or shrill treble). An obvious improvement over the included Ipod headphones.  For the price, pretty much an easy choice.  They are comfortable to wear, only limitation is that they offer some, but not much, isolation from external noise.","Would recommend this product. Bought these for my daughter and she loves them very much and the pouch that came with it is very handy. Would recommend this product. The sound quality is really good and they are comforatable for many hours of use.","Good Product. Good product for the cost. Good sound quality, folds easily and can be used a variety of settings. Nice price","It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones.. It works,.... the sound really come out from the phones.

Dre look more sturdier than this.","Koss PortaPro sounds very good and a great value. Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.","lightweight sound for lightweight money. was amazed at the price. not very good at isolation from the outside world. fit was improved by a slight bending of the bands to more securely fit the headphones to my head. for a low cost option to the mega dollar phones these are a good deal.","Good sound quality, poor construction. good sound! But very chintzy material and construction. It's going back.","Surprising for the price. For the cash you can't get better. Plus: clear sound, low power consumption, comfy pads Minus: not really collapsible, hard to adjust firmness buttons, hair gets caught in band (and I have very short hair). Mated with Cowon's I7, you'd think a fortune was spent for the amazing sound. Not suggested for devices lacking a graphic equalizer-- top treble can get harsh without modification with higher volumes. Glad I purchased the oldie but goodie.","Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.","Very good phones. I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.","Great headphones. I love these headphones. This is the second pair I've purchased (I wanted another pair for the office). I've used the first pair for years. The sound is very good - not artificially heavy on bass. I use them to listen to music in iTunes and Pandora. They are also comfortable to wear. If I could change one thing, I'd change the heavy coiled cable for something lighter.","Good for music and editing. Love 'em! They travel well, in spite of their size relative to earbuds. They fold up and go in a carry-on bag with no problems. They have great sound. I bought them for music and audio editing.","Good sound but not the quality build of years gone by. I had a pair of these in the 90s which had a stellar build, excellent audio quality, and lasted for years and years with hard use. I purchased this pair in 2014.  The audio quality is good.  Unfortunately, the build quality is not great.  I've given this pair moderate use, and the black ear cup lining is falling off -- exposing loose foam that won't last.","good. good headphones, worth the money. i agree with others that the band that sits on your nead does catch your hair, thats about the only negative thing i can say, as far as the sound goes there good!","prefer Sportapro. I bought these headphones thinking I was moving up slightly from my Koss Sportapros. Wrong! They are a half step down in sound quality.  Specs say they should be at least as good but in reality they have a 'tinnier' sound.","Greatest portable headphones under $100. Best portable headphones for under $50, maybe even $100.

The sliders that adjusts the tension in the band move to max tension at the slightest touch.","Not for me. The sound was good. But I never got these adjusted to be comfortable with my glasses, and the foam pads don't feel very substantial. As a result, I don't wear them. I keep using my earbuds instead.","Good sound, but there are others that are its equal.. The sound of these cans is good but there are others that are its equal that have some better ergonomics.  The ergonomics are good once you get them on, but the headband and the \"Tension Adjustment\" for the earpads are fiddly.

Very good value.","Retro goodness - Premium Sound. Easily my favorite headphones at this price range. While the styling is dated it also has a unique look to it that you learn to either love or hate. Beyond the looks which frankly may turn some off these are some fantastic quality headphones. The sound quality is far above what you expect. I consider myself somewhat of a snob when it comes to headphones. Lastly if you wear glasses these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned for wearing with glasses.","Great for working out cause they stay on your head. I love these because they stay on your head, so you can use them for working out. There are better headphones, but not in this price range, and those will fall off your head if you lean\/bend when exercising\/dancing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSome people use ear buds, but I do not like anything in my ear for more reasons than one.","Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.","The sound is simply the best. Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews?  Because they sound amazing.  Nothing in this price range even comes close.  Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.  Well, I have both and they are both excellent headphones, and the sennheisers are much better quality, but the sound of the Portapros is much better.  I am on my second pair, and will buy another when this set breaks.","The best headphones you can get for less than $50. I needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever I go. These deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids. The bass could be stronger, but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range. Love the retro look. The foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bag.","Best Bang For Your Buck. These are excellent headphones, especially for their price range. The only other headphones that could come close to these would be the Sennheiser PX100s, and even those aren't as good (weaker bass, and not as durable). Also, with these having a lifetime warranty, you can't go wrong either. The PortaPros come with my highest recommendation!","GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!","Beautiful frequency range, look fairly durable.. See title.  Both my wife and I love these, they fit nice, very nice price, look reasonably durable, and the sound range is everything I can hear.  What's not to like?","Great sound for price range. Awesome sound, especially at this price range.  I didn't want to pay more than $30-40 for headphones, but these were a significant upgrade in sound from my previous (cheaper) pair.

There are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours, so I will only mention a few points:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n1) I had the Sportapros. They sound great, too (same drivers), but the Portapros are really worth the extra $13 or so bucks you'll spend on them. The PPs are much more robust, and look better IMHO. Just spend the extra cash, you won't be disappointed.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n2) No questions asked lifetime warranty.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n3) They sound FANTASTIC for most of us average joe's who love music, and tend to boost bass and treble on EQs.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are worth every penny!","Some Of The Best Headphones You Can Buy!

These only fit well when the headband is fully deployed, and it invariably ends of pinching the short hairs off my head (not painfully, thankfully).","Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.","Great Headphones. Fro the price these are hard to beat.

Some of the very best headphones made. Excellent sound and very good external noise rejection, without the use of electronics.","Great sounding, but add some color to music. Great sounding, but these do add some coloration to the playback.  Perhaps they need more break-in time.  Other than that, these have excellent clear sound and bass.  Headphones or speakers should be completely neutral.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut I still give them 5 star.  For less money try Panasoinc RP-HT21 lightweights.","Just a classic. Still love the Porta Pros, which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound. Koss really nailed it with the Porta Pros, which are much more valued in Europe, I found out from a friend. Excellent warm sound, a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience, not at all.","Excellent sound quality. Like most of you I never listened to these prior to my purchase but read the reviews in detail. The sound quality is extremely good on my iPhone & iPads. Excellent bass, midrange & treble. Very comfortable. Happen to recently own the superb Beyerdynamic A200 p DAC\/Headphone Amp which really turns these headphones to amazing quality sound, but they are still excellent without this.\r\r\r\nIn my opinion these could sell for $200 & still be a good value if you like quality sound from an iPhone.","I'm old enough to remember when these came out. Still rockin'. Still excellent sound quality. Love these classic headphones. Really warm toned and well-rounded. If you are hating those tinny-sounding earbuds that make your ears itch, and want a rich smoothness to your jam, try these. For the price, there is not a better sounding portable headphone- ask any audio engineer or sound professional.","Excellent headphones, just make sure you don't need a microphone.

Excellent sound quality all across the spectrum except it leaves something to be desired for on the low end of the frequency spectrum. Once you get below 60hz it really begins to taper off quickly the further down you go in freq. It's defintely high quality bass sound, not muddy, just soft. Extremely comfortable! I just expected these to have better bass response than they did.","Great, cheap headphones.. Yep. An old classic. No styling changes for 20-plus years. But they got it right the first time. Very lightweight and excellent sound. I use Grados for my serious listening, but these are just super for portable use. Probably why they call them 'PortaPro.' Only complaint, the top band is a little tweeky and thin. A wider band would render these bad boys perfect. Can't do better for the bucks though. Happy listening!!!!!","Either love it or hate it. Classic for a reason. Great sound, great looks (imo) and sturdy construction. Love that it comes with a leather carrying case. Koss has been in the game for a long time.

I'm a pretty discerning audiophile, and I would say that the reviews of these headphones are justified.  Using them with an IPod they were very musical and detailed, without an overhyped or overemphasized sound (ie exaggerated bass or dry or shrill treble). An obvious improvement over the included Ipod headphones.  For the price, pretty much an easy choice.  They are comfortable to wear, only limitation is that they offer some, but not much, isolation from external noise.","Great headphones. I love these headphones.

The Koss PortaPro Headphones are extraordinarily portable, as they fold and slide into an small extremely space.

There are better headphones, but not in this price range, and those will fall off your head if you lean\/bend when exercising\/dancing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSome people use ear buds, but I do not like anything in my ear for more reasons than one.","Very good, functional and lives to the promise of its price-range.. Great for the price, sleek design and clear sound. I use it on my laptop, and bass is nice. Better than a comparable Sannheiser I recently returned. Certainly, this is not a top-of the line product, and to many real audiophiles this will be not even a low end. But for a general consumer like myself, it's \"good enough.\"\r\r\r\nRecommended.","Great sound. Bad design. Alrighty this headphone is so good at producing very accurate sound considering its price. There is one design flaw and it was very prominently let it down for me. The steel bars will snatch your hair while adjusting or placing the phone over your head. Also the cables are weak and broke for me. Now I upgraded to M50 and feel so much better","What a Great Buy. Great Sound for the price! While it may look retro, the sound it creates can't be beat for the price you pay.","Pretty good.. These headphones are ugly but sound great, they are also very comfortable.  Perfect for home, I wouldn't wear these out as they are goofy looking and are not noise-cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPROS\r\r\r\n- Sound is great, bass and all.\r\r\r\n- iPod\/iPhone friendly plug.\r\r\r\n- Lightweight and comfortable.\r\r\r\n- The price is right.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONS\r\r\r\n- Need to re-adjust the head band occasionally when you put them back on as it will slide when you take them off.\r\r\r\n- Not very cool looking, I would probably buy these in black if I was ordering again.","GREAT sounding, high price.... I LOVE these headphones, but why the mediocre star-age??  Because I think they're overpriced.  Depending on when you buy them, they range in the $35-40 range, which in my opinion is too much.  Reasonably I'd pay $20-25...  These don't exactly scream quality when you get them, they are a great basic headphone, that sound fantastic, but look like they're made from about $6 of material.  Check the prices often, and buy when the price dips below $30!","like them. audio quality is great for the price bracket, but they feel flimsy. However, I haven't goofed up and done anything bad to them yet. I just wish that the build quality was a little better so I wouldn't be paranoid every time I used them.","Koss PortaPro sounds very good and a great value. Koss PortaPro is light and sounds very good but not spetacular, of course you do not expect it to be at the price. A great value.","Great Buy for Portable Headphone. For the price one of the best portable Headphones I have owned.  Great sound and light weight","Either love it or hate it. Classic for a reason. Great sound, great looks (imo) and sturdy construction. Love that it comes with a leather carrying case. Koss has been in the game for a long time. A quick search of this headphone on any respected audio\/video forum will reveal largely positive reviews for excellent sound quality compared to the price point.","Gooddeal until they broke. These worked pretty well until the cord went bad near the headphone jack.  Not uncommon, but frustrating. The sound quality was better than the price, but still not great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe lifetime manufacturer's warranty sounds great, and I am sure it is if you purchase a more expensive pair of headphones, but the company needs you to pay to ship it to them and include $9.00 for return shipping.  If you pay that, you are out $15 for a pair of headphone that cost $35.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo yourself a favor.  Buy a nicer pair of headphones.","Very good phones. I have been looking for good moderately priced headphones for some time. Koss offers a an excellent product.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  Great bass, highly enjoyable sound.  Sounds a little heavy but still very listenable.  Please replace those ear buds and enjoy great music. Highly recommended.","Great sound for the price. Great sound for the price. They have a very expansive and detailed sound with plenty of bass for such small drivers. They're super light but can be uncomfortable based on the locking mechanism on the earpad swivel. Some people also complain about their hair getting caught in the headband. If you don't like in-ear headphones and want something for traveling without any outside noise-blocking, these would be a great choice, IMO.","Great Headphones. Fro the price these are hard to beat. I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point. Lifetime warranty as well.","Portability and Easy Listening. Pros:\r\r\r\n- Sound is decent for its price\r\r\r\n- Very compact when folded and placed in case; great for traveling.\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n- No noise cancellation\r\r\r\n- When adjusting, band gets separated causing hair to get stuck in the band; quite painful.\r\r\r\nNotes:\r\r\r\n- To adjust without worrying about hair, it's best to adjust it to the maximum length and then place it on your head and push the sides of the metal bands together until it fits.","great pair of foldable headphones. i already have a set and this was a purchase for my wife. great headphones for the price. they fold and store, have deep clear sound and have a lifetime warranty. my other set got a frayed cord, so for $7 i sent them back and koss replaced them with the newer version! an excellent value for the money. i use them with an ipod and an ipod shuffle and they do the job really well.","Great sound for price range. Awesome sound, especially at this price range.  I didn't want to pay more than $30-40 for headphones, but these were a significant upgrade in sound from my previous (cheaper) pair.  Only downside is that the metal band has a sharp corner that sometime bothers my ear.","Great. The sound quality is absolutely amazing; they are lightweight and suitable for walking\/hiking.  The only downside is they cannot survive rough treatment so as long as you take delicate care of them, they are a great choice at a reasonable price.","Great Headphones! Great price!!.

You can easily follow along with more bass lines.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy only complain is as soon as I plug in, I head tons of static. This is very annoying and makes me questions the durability of the 'phones.","related_to":"Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil","discussion_id":"B00001WRSJ","discussion_name":"Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones with CCAW Voice Coil","user_id":"A35O0043BLN6FS","discourse":"Neutral","dominant_topic":14,"topic_phrase":"my my ears","topic_keywords":["be","headphone","sound","good","-PRON-","have","great","not","can","use"],"lemmas":["love","be","great","headphone","affordable","price","lot","people","say","be","too","bright","be","not","entirely","true","couple","hour","burn","high","smooth","turn","smooth","flat","-PRON-","favorite","thing","headphone","be","bass","very","deep","clear","can","easily","follow","more","bass","line","-PRON-","only","complain","be","as","soon","plug","head","ton","static","be","very","annoying","make","question","durability","phone"]},{"comment_id":860,"comment":"Very well made product..

I have always been fascinated by music, and I have also heard my share of symphonies and life performances in my day. With that being said, I LOVE these headphones. Before them, I had Bose Triports. However, these far outshine them in every way. Since they are studio monitor headphones, they really do sound great with every genre. They are definitely worth the buy!","sound quality. fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement","These are the most comfortable things my ears have ever had the privilege to ....

Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.","Great Sound!. Great headphones for the price. The quality is amazing, I can hear sounds I never did with my small earbuds. Although after an hour or so your ears get warm the sound quality makes up for it!!","Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case. The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.","Can't beat them.. Bought these on Black Friday at almost half the cost, to replace a pair that I got twenty years ago or so.  The old ones have lost a little bit of their sound quality, but still work fine, although the coating has worn off the pads.  These new ones are a noticeable improvement in sound.","The MDRV6s are superior to the MDR7506. Had these headphones evaluated side by side with the Sony MDR7506. Twice. The MDRV6s are superior to the latter. They have more balanced, neutral, accurate range which is much better for quality music listening. The MDR7506, although also good, are overly bright, with less bass and thinner sound.","Worth the Investment. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase these headphones. I'm really glad I did. They arrived quickly in the mail after my order was placed. They are the highest quality headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is great and they fold up nicely. I have not experienced the discomfort that some other reviewers have complained about. My only complaint is that the cord is long and not detachable","Kickin in the beat. These headphones are .....sleek....compact....durable....and most importantly do provide superior sound quality.  I got these instead of other pairs b\/c of all the fantabulous reviews on here, and they are pretty good. the sound really does sound perfect, and it has really really good bass, not too distorted, just enough to sound good.  plus, they come with a nice leather-esque carrying case with a rope on the top so you can cinch them up and take them anywhere.","Excellent. For the price, these can't be beat.. For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones.","These work great. My son really loves these headphones. The really cut out external sounds well and sound very full. For the cost, it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound.","Best headphones I've owned, great value for price. Best headphones I've ever owned. Very comfortable, light over-the-ear headphones. The sound is very crisp, and I definitely hear things in my music that I hadn't heard before. These are great value for the price, and are definitely higher quality than more expensive headphones I've owned (e.g. Bose). I wear glasses, and these are surprisingly comfortable even with my glasses. They're also very comfortable for long periods of time (an entire work day), unlike many on-ear head phones and in-ear earphones. Would recommend and purchase again.","Great product for the price. I spent a lot of time researching and reading product reviews before settling on this headphone. I was not disappointed. It has better than average quality and it sounds great. My only complaint are the ear pads. My first look at them made me feel that they will not last long. They are not deep enough to prevent earphone from sitting on my ears. I don't wear them for extended periods so no problem for me.","great. quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.","Durable headphones with high-quality sound. These headphones provide extremely high quality sound (including excellent bass).  You will notice a huge difference if you are used to cheap headphones or low-end speakers.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are also durable.  In the three years that I've owned mine, I haven't had any problems except for the foam earpads deteriorating.  These can be replaced for $7 on Amazon, however.","Just OK. Fits too tight and hurts my ears after awhile. Been using Sony headphones for years and the quality has gone steadily down hill. Sound quality is just OK, nothing to get excited about.","Seems good on every aspect. As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.","Good overall but not for heavy bass likers. I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.","Solid. Sturdy, comfortable, and high sound quality. What more would you like in a set of headphones? This is the second headphone set I've owned from Sony, and both were high quality items.","Good product with reasnable price. It's really a gud product and worth paying so much money for this. One thing that i noticed is it starts swaeting after couple of hours. This might a prob with me only. On the other hand it has a gud bass and sound quality. I recommend this product.","SoundHead. Great headphones!!!  Clear and precise sound, very comfortable fit.  Sony quality to boot!!!","Best All Around Headphones at a Great Price!. I wanted a set of headphones that were comfortable enough so I could wear them all day while editing, with great sound quality and durable enough to take in the field.  After talking with several others that have been working in production for years, the V6 kept coming up.  I love these headphones, they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!","Great sound, perfect fit. We're moving to an open floor plan at work to enhance \"collaboration\" which means it's going to get considerably louder and harder to concentrate.  I was looking for a decent pair of over the ear headphones and these rated pretty highly in my price range.  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).","If Not For The Flaking.... They are the real deal. Studio quality. Bummer that the shiny top layer of the ear cushions flake off. Feels good, sounds good, collapses into a small package. Would buy again.","Sony can't keep its superior design and quality as the old days. The sound quality had compromised compare to the same one I purchased in 1995. Sony can't keep its superior design and quality as the old days.","Good sound, bad ear pads. The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good, just lacking bass like a lot of headphones. They're comfortable, and the over-the-ear style reduces ambient noise but doesn't get too hot or heavy. The one problem is the ear pads, which don't hold up well. After three years they're starting to shred. These headphones don't get heavy use and the ear pads should last a lot longer. Replacements are available, though, and I plan to keep using the headphones.","Quality product, good sound, but after 1 hour uncomfortable.. I bought these during a special Amazon sale at half price.  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I use these at night when I watch TV or movies in bed.  Last night was my first try with them.  I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones, but like a few others have noted in their reviews, after about an hour I found them uncomfortable.  I replaced another pair of Sony headphones that I've had for over 5 years and those were never uncomfortable.","Awesome!. I bought these headphones for my husband when he goes on business trips, for the plane. He uses them all the time. He works from home the majority of the time, and if the kids or the dog get too loud, he just pops these babies on and fades into his own world... Great sound quality, too, he says.","Mediocre product.. Bought these for my husband who listens\/records music constantly. While they have a good sound quality, the material covering the ear phones part has begun to separate, exposing the padding inside the ear phone. We are disappointed in the quality of the product.","These headphones are sooo comfortable, this is the most important feature. These headphones are sooo comfortable, this is the most important feature...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound quality is amazing, true sound. Not \"enhanced\" like other manufacturers do.","amazing sound quality and 100% satisfied. I purchased this headphones on Nov, 2012, and have been using it for two years, amazing sound quality and 100% satisfied. Do not get any disappoint when it arrived, keep using it for couple month and you will find out the truth.","Sound quality is great!. I like this headset, sound quality was great!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNote:\r\r\r\nCord is long.. No I mean really Long...\r\r\r\nIt has an adapter for the large audio jack\r\r\r\nThey are adjustable for size\r\r\r\nThe ear pads are nice and soft","perfect. Bought these years ago. Have had to replace the ear cushions once. Still gets a little uncomfortable for long periods, but I stretched out the headband a bit for that. sound quality is still amazing.","Great desk headphones!. Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.","Excellent headphones with real studio headphone sound. I tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound. I also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars. These are the one. These excel from low to high frequencies. Bass is full but not overwhelming. Highs are exceptionally detailed. Mids are just right. I can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue. One will not find such high quality headphones for this price. Other Sony slightly cheaper studio headphones (MDR-V250V) are terrible. More expensive are not better. These are just right.","Good, but go with the MDR7506 instead.. Has a sharp hissing quality to some of the high S sounds. Hardware is pretty much identical to the MDR7506 and some people say it sounds a bit different but still as good, but really the MDR7506 sounds better.","Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.","Recording quality, or lack thereof, really comes out with these. I've never owned real fancy headphones. I had some Bose noise-canceling ones that eventually broke and I didn't want to spend another ton of money. These are very comfortable and I thoroughly enjoy listening to my music as it surrounds my head. Nothing harsh or overpowering. Just a well-balanced sound.","Good quality OTH Headphones without the high price. These are quality headphones that are very well priced. They are comfortable and have decent sound reproduction for the price.","Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.","Same Sony Quality. The quality is what you would expect of Sony, consistent and well made. I also am a Bose enthusiast, but I was impressed with all the specs on the Sony Digital headset, so I thought I would give them a try.  I was not let down, they fit good, comfort is good and the sound quality is very good.","Great Headphones. Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGreat value. Just buy them.","GREAT headphones. GOOD value for the money. Very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periods.","I like the sound. there's like almost 1000 reviews at the time of writing this.  I can only say the quality it very good.  I have ears which approach a size only talked about in National Geographic.  So the one issue I have is the pads are too small.","High Quality, Very Nice Sound!. A bit large, a bit heavy, they get kind of warm if you've had them on for a while, and the coiled cord is a bit clumsy.  However, they sound really great; and, I'd clearly buy them again!","great purchase indeed.. unbelievable sound quality enough said.\r\r\r\ni just got these head phones and tried it on my piano keyboard and i was just blow away by the bass quality and the rest tones of the audio range.\r\r\r\ni always trust sony products...well done.","Five Stars. Good sound quality.  I like the sound better than the Bose AE2.","Amazing, long lasting headphones.. I love these headphones. These are the exact headphones my dad has had for 20+ years. Amazing sound quality and extremely comfortable. And they must last long, since my dad still has his. What more can I say? They're amazing.","Five Stars. Great quality stereo sound with these headphones.  So glad I purchased them, well worth the money.","Excellent Quality Sound, Can't Hear Outside Sounds. I've had these headphones on at a reasonable volume, and I cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me.  The sound quality is excellent.  I want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing mine.","Great sound. Really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones.  They fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on."]},{"ngram":"sound great","count":88,"ngram_comments":["Good and bad, but mostly bad.. They sound great, but the earpad material disintegrates after a few months.  If you don't mind little black particles all over you ears after wearing these headphones, then I wholly recommend them.\r\r\r\nI threw mine away after dealing with a very unhelpful customer service rep.  They were still under warranty but they wanted me to pay for the repair.","Great headphones, pads are a little uncomfortable.. Great sounding headphones for the money! If you're familiar with Sony audio products you know that they're pretty much junk but the headphones are an exception to the rule. These can easily beat much more expensive headphones and beats or bose can't even come close, much less in the $50-100 range.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMinus one star for the pads being pretty uncomfortable, I added a pair of Brainwavz angled memory foam pads for $25 to turn them into a great pair of headphones.","Nice headphones. Great sound,very comfortable .I bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older Sony set. I bought the older Sony from EBAY,beware when doing this,it was a fake Sony. Bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the Sony MDR-V6 was inferior. The fakes are hard to detect,there are web sites that go over ways to check.","Happy ears. Happy with Koss PortaPro. Light, comfortable, adjusts easily, great sound quality, while allowing to hear a phone next room ringing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWhat Porta name has to do with it, beats me. Not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed, or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it, but a nice touch.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHappy ears.","Great sound! Best pair I ever had.. Great sound! Clean and nice bass. Works with iPhone 6, but there seems to be some connection issues that produce statics.","By far the best Studio headphones for the price.  Great sound and comfort.. By far the best Studio headphones for the price.  Great sound and comfort.","Great gift, amazing sound for the money.. My friend loves these headphones. I got him this for Christmas and he has loved them ever since!","Very impressed. Excellent sound, very comfortable fit, the great quality I have come to expect from Sony products.","Five Star Headphones. These headphones are great! They give what some people call a flat sound...just the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo. In other words no excentuated highs, basses or midrange. They are ruggedly constructed for professional use. They are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback. The plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warm.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBuy them. You won't be sorry.","Good cans! Not such great passive sound isolation though. Great for open offices.. They sound great but the sound sealing for passive noise reduction is not good enough for flying. Great for open offices though.","Perfect for all music genres! Superb sound quality!. I have always been fascinated by music, and I have also heard my share of symphonies and life performances in my day. With that being said, I LOVE these headphones. Before them, I had Bose Triports. However, these far outshine them in every way. Since they are studio monitor headphones, they really do sound great with every genre. They are definitely worth the buy!","sound quality. fantastic range and clarity for the money. able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placement","Great for the price. These headphones sound amazingly good and are even better considering I got them for around $70 (Refurbished).\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey fit very well in my head and I can use them for hours. They also fold and come with a pretty nice carrying bag.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWould definitely purchase again!","Fantastic sound. Purchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing.  He likes to listen to music on an MP3 player while mowing the lawn.  These work well, he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise.  He is very please with them.","These are the most comfortable things my ears have ever had the privilege to .... These are the most comfortable things my ears have ever had the privilege to come into contact with. A+\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound quality is great too.","Great choice to replace earbuds. I find earbuds to be very uncomfortable. These Koss Portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my MP3 player. They are comfortable to wear, have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz. They are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel. I'm very happy with my choice.","Great sound, ok comfort. Pro:\r\r\r\nGreat sound.  Fairly effective sound isolation.  Well built.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n i don't find these headphones to be super comfortable for extended wear.\r\r\r\n1) They are tight on my head\r\r\r\n2) My ears are bigger than the hole, so they kind of pinch.\r\r\r\nIt might be that after a while they'll stretch out or relax to my head.... and they will become more comfortable.","Great Comfort and Great Sound. I bought these after wearing a pair of $50 skullCandy Headphones for about 2 years. Wow there is a difference. These headphones seems to have crystal clear audio and a flat EQ. It's taking me a while to get use to them but I feel I will be able to create better mixes with these. They even cancel out sound pretty good.","Great Headphones. I have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews.  These have a great clear sound, not too bottom heavy like some headphones can be....they can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tunes.","crackle in bass. First pair I bought got stolen outta my car, somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :(\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAnyway, first pair sounded great.\r\r\r\nI bought another pair, there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency.  This made me extremely annoyed\/angry\/disappointed.  I cannot stand bad crap, and I hate to give bad product reviews. But I had to send it back and now I will look for a different company brand, probably for the rest of my life.","Great Sound!. Great headphones for the price. The quality is amazing, I can hear sounds I never did with my small earbuds. Although after an hour or so your ears get warm the sound quality makes up for it!!","The other reviews were correct.. I can't believe I got by for years without owning these, as a music lover.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI got chills right away the first time I cranked up some favorite tunes with these new (old) cans. (Well, new to me.)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe frequency response is supposedly 5-30K Hz. At this price point, you'd be hard pressed to find better, I should think.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGood seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while. GREAT sound.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nShort and sweet, well worth the cost.","Great sound. This is my first pair of real headphones, but I can say that they sound so much better than the cheap ear buds I have owned in the past.","Great sound. Second pair I've owned I use them when I record music.","Great cans, but not for transporting around. Sound is great, it fits well over my ears, and the cable is long enough that I don't worry about ripping it out of the outlet. Note, though, that if you're going to be carting these around, you'll probably want to get a case. They don't feel unsturdy, but I'd hate to bend them up in a backpack, and the wires seem a little less protected than they could be. Sitting on a desk, they'll probably last forever.","Great headphones.  There's a reason they are a classic.. These are classics,  Read the reviews.  These made me a better listener and make me seriously thing twice before using my custom IEM's over these.  Sound great!","Not bad for the money.... These headphones are OK but the bass is a little underwhelming. Great for music like Michael Buble or some Sonatra, but don't really give you the right sound for \"modern music.\" I have to hand it to Amazon though, they got to my house in less than a day and I didn't even get expedited shipping","Great Headphones. I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them.","Work great.... These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound. Tough to beat for the cost, and the Koss warrenty is the best. Highly recommend.","GREAT FOR FLYING. I am a tentative flyer and needed a good pair of headsets that would eliminate the noise of the plane, has great sound, and doesn't break the bank.  I use them with my iTouch and they are fantastic.  I bought some padded ear cushions thinking I would need them, but I didn't.  These are very comfortable.","Simply Amazing. Simply amazing is all i can say about these headphones. I think they are the best headphones for 100 or less. I have tried senns, sonys, skullcandys and numerous other brands and none sound as good as the porta pro's. the headphones really sound great, excellent actually. it is hard to beat these headphones, throw in the lifetime no questions ask warranty and it really is a no brainer. the only flaw i see is that it can at times pull your hair when taking them on\/off.","Nice cans.. Buy them. Light, comfortable and great sound. I will say that I was disappointed at first. Initially they are too (painfully) bright, but after about 30 hours I was really impressed.","Great Sound.. Great sound. Comfortable on head and ears. Ears do get warm after a 90 minute movie. I hope they last a long time.","Great headphones. These sound great.  One star removed because a) it's easy to knock the cushion off the earpiece and very difficult to get it back on and b) the curly cord is a pain - it gets knotted up on itself easily and is generally in the way.  A straight cord would be better.","Worth the Investment. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase these headphones. I'm really glad I did. They arrived quickly in the mail after my order was placed. They are the highest quality headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is great and they fold up nicely. I have not experienced the discomfort that some other reviewers have complained about. My only complaint is that the cord is long and not detachable","Excellent. For the price, these can't be beat.. For the price, you can't beat these. I'm an audio nut. These headphones are balanced. Very versatile. Great quality and comfortable fit. Can't see a headphone beating these out (for the price). They sound like $300+ headphones.","Great Headphones. Fit is a little big.. I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.","Great sounding for a great price. Sound great.  I have a $300 pair of Beats headphones and these sounded a lot clearer.  I hadn't noticed how the beats sounded like I was listening through a tin can.  I would recommend these headphones to anyone.","Popular with professionals for a reason. I have a couple pairs of these and they're great. Nice, natural, clear sound without exaggerated bass, weak highs, etc. - they're just  great all around.","These work great. My son really loves these headphones. The really cut out external sounds well and sound very full. For the cost, it is really hard to find this kind of quality in sound.","Best headphones I've owned, great value for price. Best headphones I've ever owned. Very comfortable, light over-the-ear headphones. The sound is very crisp, and I definitely hear things in my music that I hadn't heard before. These are great value for the price, and are definitely higher quality than more expensive headphones I've owned (e.g. Bose). I wear glasses, and these are surprisingly comfortable even with my glasses. They're also very comfortable for long periods of time (an entire work day), unlike many on-ear head phones and in-ear earphones. Would recommend and purchase again.","Great response without coloring the sound too much. You can't go wrong with any of these Sony headphones.. I love these headphones.\r\r\r\nGreat response without coloring the sound too much.\r\r\r\nYou can't go wrong with any of these Sony headphones.","Great sound. I really like these Koss portapro headphones, the over all tonal balance is just right, only minor objection is that they fit a little bit too tight, but i would recommend them.","Sweet sounding for a great price.. These phones are really comfortable. I have flown overseas and worn them for hours at a time with no problem. They sound really good and for the price, I don't think you can beat em.","Nice sound. Great sound and no problems so far. I like the ear cups and the overall fit, they do not pinch your head. Great value for the price. I would recommend these to a friend.","Great product for the price. I spent a lot of time researching and reading product reviews before settling on this headphone. I was not disappointed. It has better than average quality and it sounds great. My only complaint are the ear pads. My first look at them made me feel that they will not last long. They are not deep enough to prevent earphone from sitting on my ears. I don't wear them for extended periods so no problem for me.","Great for home stereo. I'd been wanting these for awhile and was able to get them as a daily deal at a great price. I've been using them in rotation with other headphones on my computer system and they were very clean and neutral. I might add that they are very comfortable as well. Just recently I've been listening to them with my home stereo system.( Harman Kardon receiver). They really sound great on the higher powered system. I really feel that this is what this phones were built for.","great. quality is heard here. nice fit and doesn't smash my head.  I wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that don't hurt.  sound with great and drowns out back noise well.","Super Headphones!. I am very pleased with these headphones.  They produce great sound, are light weight and adjustable, and fold to a very compact size.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack (which is very rarely found) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks (which are required for using these headphones on an airplane).  I couldn't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only.  Oh well, otherwise they're great.","SONY MDR-V6. The MDR-V6 Headphones work great,and I am completely satisfied with them. The sound is as was expected and the 'fit' wasn't too snug. A great headset with a great price! I watched numerous reviews on various headphone reviews and, for the price, this was the one. For listening to music and being able to relax without distracting 'outside' noise, this one works great!","You won't be let down!. I love these. They accompany my Sansa Clip+ perfectly. After burning them in for 40hours and RockBoxing my clip, I could not be happier with my $115.00 total portable audio solution(Sansa Clip+ MDR-V6. These sound great with iPods as well! Bass, mids and highs are great for musical scores, hip hop, electronica, big band jazz, and classical. Great buy!","these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when .... Was using the v600s until they discontinued them. At this price point, these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when I DJ.  There's definitely a break-in period and they sound even better after a few hours of use.","Sounds great. I wish they would make a new version .... Sounds great. I wish they would make a new version with a removable aux cord and better ear pads.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe ear pads on my broken Turtle Beach Recon 50 fit these perfectly and are much more comfortable than the original.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI also tried the 1\/4-inch adapter with my old record player and it sounded great. I could really hear every microscopic scratch on my old Hotel California record.","SoundHead. Great headphones!!!  Clear and precise sound, very comfortable fit.  Sony quality to boot!!!","Best All Around Headphones at a Great Price!. I wanted a set of headphones that were comfortable enough so I could wear them all day while editing, with great sound quality and durable enough to take in the field.  After talking with several others that have been working in production for years, the V6 kept coming up.  I love these headphones, they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!","Great sound, perfect fit.

I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).","Very good headphone for the price!. I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price","Best headphones for the price. This is simply the best sounding headphones for under $100.  The bass is incredible, the sound is crispy clear.  When I commute in the train, I can hardly hear any noise, and the comfort is great.","Nice sound and fit. These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable.  I use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound. They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch. The cord is a bit short but otherwise they're great.","Awesome!. I bought these headphones for my husband when he goes on business trips, for the plane. He uses them all the time. He works from home the majority of the time, and if the kids or the dog get too loud, he just pops these babies on and fades into his own world...

Exceeded my expectations.\r\r\r\n7\/17\/2017 update:  They still impress me every time that I put them on -- can't believe how great they sound.","Great headphones. Bought these for someone else as a gift and they felt and sounded so good I decided to keep them for myself.","Excellent value. Impressed.. Excellent headphones. Comfy and great coiled cord. Sound is great if you care. I fall asleep with them on. Would feel guilty spending more knowing about these for 50.00.","Sound quality is great!.

No I mean really Long...\r\r\r\nIt has an adapter for the large audio jack\r\r\r\nThey are adjustable for size\r\r\r\nThe ear pads are nice and soft","There Just Fine. Works Great if you're not planning on getting sweaty, Sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the XtremeMac  class of Ear\/Headsets on the market.","Great desk headphones!. Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.","Great sound with great bass hands down.. Need I say more about these?  These are decades old and STILL better than those gimmicky Beats crap headphones.  The only drawback of these are the ear covers that tend to flake off.  Yes the oils around your ear will get on the ear pads.  I gently wipe them off occasionally.  However at some point they do wear off.  They sell replacement ear pads and third party manufacturers sell them cheap.","Blown away by these. Wow I had no idea how good these were til they came in. Blew my expectations out of the water and became one of my favorite headphones ever even over my Bose. great comfort; they run with a flat EQ so you will need a program to change the EQ settings for the sound to get that perfect sound.","Audophile and pleasantly surprised!. I probably have 10 different styles of headphones, Bose, Beats, in-ear style sport headphones, etc.  The sound on these rank above all of the others and the price is great! I can see why these headphones have stood the test of time. I like that you can cheaply replace the parts should the need arise. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.","Great for Rock and current pop, less so for classical. This headphone is especially good for rock, less so for classical.  It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.","feels cheap and plasticky but sounds great.. I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug, these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $5.00 i could not pass them up. They're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices.","Excellent over-the-ear sound !!!. After spending a great deal more money at a large retailer and being very dissapointed, I ordered these headphones. The sound is fantastic for all around music. I listen to TOOL, Pink Floyd, John Mayer, SADE and SRV. Whether I am listening to classical or blues these headphones really surround you.","10 years later.... ...and still going strong and sounding great. Must be the ultimate bargain in headphones.","Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.","Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.

Very rich sound for the price.  Have owned this product for several years and the sound is spot on but the earpads flaked badly and fall off repeatedly which is a pain in the ass to deal with.  See many similar complaints.","Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Headphones - No complaints, good sound!. My very 1st Studio Monitor Headphones & I love it! After reading many reviews for 4weeks I finally decided to buy this Sony MDRV6 & no regrets on my part. Great headphones, great sound for the price, been using it for 2months now & everything sounds so much better than my old Panasonic RP-HTX7-P1.","Five Stars. Great quality stereo sound with these headphones.  So glad I purchased them, well worth the money.","Awkward-Looking, But Great Sound!. I've had my PortaPros for several years now, and they've served me very, very well.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Best sound I've heard in a small portable headphone. (My Grado SR-80s sound better, but there's no way you'd walk down the street in 'em)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Fold reasonably well into a coat-pocketable clump\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Durable as heck (other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers).  I use the heck out of these, and they take it in stride.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Look pretty un-cool.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Foam earpiece covers need replacing every 50 or so uses - cheap and readily-available from Koss, takes a minute to do.","Good mid-range headphone. The Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series sound great and for the price are a very good purchase. I have had more expensive models in the past and these sound as good as many of the higher end models I have owned. Very happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anybody in the market for a mid priced set of headphones. Work great for both music and watching TV late at night.","Superior Response On Vocals. I was surprised by the details in vocal reverb-tail, but the overall sound response is a bit questionable.\r\r\r\nI don't recommend this headphone on mixing work. works really great for the booth headphones.","Great sound. Really love the sound quality and comfort of the headphones.  They fit well and feel comfortable even hours after putting them on."]},{"ngram":"ear pads","count":29,"ngram_comments":["Had mine since 2000. Had these since 2000. The ear pads flaked off completely, but I don't care. Nothing else broke. Still can't beat these. I bent the plug a little by stepping on it, but it still works. The carrying pouch is pretty useful, don't lose it.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI still don't understand what the deal with beats headphones are.","Got mine in 1988.... No, that is not  a typo; using these since nineteen eighty-eight... and they are still going strong. The only way to tell them from new is that the soft (leather or leather-like) covering of the ear pads wore down bit by bit over the years to the point when I finally tore the remnants off - that was probably six to ten years ago. The bare cloth underneath works just as well though.","Good sound - a little Tinny (not Tiny). These are good quality sounding headphone (just a little bit tinny) and has a comfortable headband with multi stereo adapters. Only but... is the cheapy black sponge foam ear pads don't last more than a year with daily use.","Very good item. The Sony MDR-V6 headphones sound awesome  and are very comfortable even after prolonged use . They seem solidly built except for the flimsy ear pads , which are replaceable.\r\r\r\n I recommend these headphones but be prepared to replace the ear pads !!","Far better than most 300 dollar headphones.. A relative bargain when compared to \"fashion lifestyle\" headphones.  The Sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones.  The ear pads will fall apart after a year or two, so expect to have to replace them.  This happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad.  This isn't unique to Sony.","Sony MDR-V6 Dynamic Stereo Headphones. Best headphones for the money.  Bought my first set in 1989,which I still have. Did have to replace the ear pads. The black fake leather covering did seem to degenerate and flake off quickly. So did the exterior of the head band. Nevertheless, I will continue buying these headphones until hell freezes over. Can you use the word \"hell\" in a review? If not there's more where hell came from.","Poorly designed ear pads. After not many hours of use, the entire ear pad on one side became detached from the plastic base plate. The synthetic leather covering was either press fitted or glued over the edge of this plastic part. It looked like I probably could have stretched the thing back over the plastic lip, although it would have taken some time. But because it would certainly have happened again with normal use anyway, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. What a waste. Overall, a very poor design in my view.","Can't beat them.. Bought these on Black Friday at almost half the cost, to replace a pair that I got twenty years ago or so.  The old ones have lost a little bit of their sound quality, but still work fine, although the coating has worn off the pads.  These new ones are a noticeable improvement in sound.","Good for the price. I use these at work to drown out my annoying coworkers.  They don't last forever, the cord is a little weak and the ear pads aren't super durable and the cheap foam degrades, but the price reflects that.  I keep my AKGs at home for when I need real headphones.","Four Stars. Nice pair of monitor phones. Ear pads started breaking down, even after wiping off after use.","great for $50. For $50 bucks, these are pretty awesome. My only issue is comfort. I have large ears (better to hear you with) and the pads sit on my ears causing hot spots (this has been an issue with every headphone that I have used except for a Senheiser model I had many years ago but they were really flimsy and didn't survive for long, too much cheap plastic). But for $50, these are pretty awesome.","The best!. I've owned or tried some of the best headphones out there. For the money, these are far and away the best value. No, they aren't noise cancelling, but the large over the ear pads completely cover the ear and block out 99% of the sound anyhow. You won't regret buying these unless Bose has succeeded in convincing you that you have to spend $300 to get good sound.","Great product for the price. I spent a lot of time researching and reading product reviews before settling on this headphone. I was not disappointed. It has better than average quality and it sounds great. My only complaint are the ear pads. My first look at them made me feel that they will not last long. They are not deep enough to prevent earphone from sitting on my ears. I don't wear them for extended periods so no problem for me.","Durable headphones with high-quality sound. These headphones provide extremely high quality sound (including excellent bass).  You will notice a huge difference if you are used to cheap headphones or low-end speakers.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are also durable.  In the three years that I've owned mine, I haven't had any problems except for the foam earpads deteriorating.  These can be replaced for $7 on Amazon, however.","I bought the MDRV6 when I first got into radio .... I bought the MDRV6 when I first got into radio in 1990 and I'm still using the very same pair to this day, though I've replaced the ear pads twice so far... I do use other headphones\/earbuds as appropriate for the circumstances, but for broadcasting, studio work, listening to binaural beats, or just need to hear with precision, these have always been and remain my go-to headphones.","Save your money. Piece of crap, the ear pads keep coming off.  I should have just bought the Beats headphones by dr. dre instead.","Sounds great. I wish they would make a new version .... Sounds great. I wish they would make a new version with a removable aux cord and better ear pads.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe ear pads on my broken Turtle Beach Recon 50 fit these perfectly and are much more comfortable than the original.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI also tried the 1\/4-inch adapter with my old record player and it sounded great. I could really hear every microscopic scratch on my old Hotel California record.","Good sound, bad ear pads. The sound quality of these headphones is pretty good, just lacking bass like a lot of headphones. They're comfortable, and the over-the-ear style reduces ambient noise but doesn't get too hot or heavy. The one problem is the ear pads, which don't hold up well. After three years they're starting to shred. These headphones don't get heavy use and the ear pads should last a lot longer. Replacements are available, though, and I plan to keep using the headphones.","Good Affordable Studio Headphones for digital audio.. Solid Headphones - I've used them for years and bought these to replace the old version.  This version is made for digital audio and has a greater frequency range than the older version.  The biggest issue with these headphones is that the plastic cover for the ear pads always tears up after a couple years or so, but you can purchase replacements which I never do.","Great headphones for the $$$. Sure, there are better and worse headphones out there, but, for the price, these are tough to beat imo. My son is a computer game fanatic, and I thought that he'd eventually want to upgrade from these. However, after two years of use, and replacing the worn out ear pads, he's still happy with their performance, to my surprise, as he often wants the latest, and greatest, but is still very satisfied with these. Hmmm, no wonder many radio stations around the country, use these as well, imo, they are a proven performer.","Sound quality is great!. I like this headset, sound quality was great!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNote:\r\r\r\nCord is long.. No I mean really Long...\r\r\r\nIt has an adapter for the large audio jack\r\r\r\nThey are adjustable for size\r\r\r\nThe ear pads are nice and soft","Great sound with great bass hands down.. Need I say more about these?  These are decades old and STILL better than those gimmicky Beats crap headphones.  The only drawback of these are the ear covers that tend to flake off.  Yes the oils around your ear will get on the ear pads.  I gently wipe them off occasionally.  However at some point they do wear off.  They sell replacement ear pads and third party manufacturers sell them cheap.","wrong description, ear pads falling apart. wrong description these do not cover your ear completely. Also i would like to return them for a new pair or refund because the ear pads are falling apart at the seams, definitely a manufacturing defect, after very light use. Do not buy!","Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.","I like the sound. there's like almost 1000 reviews at the time of writing this.  I can only say the quality it very good.  I have ears which approach a size only talked about in National Geographic.  So the one issue I have is the pads are too small.","Like the sound of Sony studio monitor head phones. Great head phones, terrific sound.  Wish the ear pads stayed secured better.  They come off once in awhile.","Great.. Audio 5 stars.\r\r\r\nAfter 2 years, changed the pads. Old ones started to tear off.\r\r\r\nNOW this is the problem\r\r\r\nA while back I discovered that the headphone plug is too short vs other plugs. It doesn't push all the way through and so, it pops back and leaves me without audio. Great.","Best I own, but not an audiophile. Wearing them now for over 7 hours straight.  I haven't even replace the stock ear pads either.  Love the sound for music, video games, videos.  The cable is long and heavy, but for me that isn't a real problem.","Great sound\/crappy earpads.

They were still under warranty but they wanted me to pay for the repair.","Nice headphones. Great sound,very comfortable .I bought the headphones for a replacement  for my older Sony set. I bought the older Sony from EBAY,beware when doing this,it was a fake Sony. Bought at a good price but the overall quality compared to the Sony MDR-V6 was inferior. The fakes are hard to detect,there are web sites that go over ways to check.","Now it's got a buzz in one ear!!!.

I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED, HOWEVER, BY THE EXPOSED WIRES CONNECTING EACH SIDE OF THE EARPHONES.  THESE EARPHONES SOUND VERY GOOD WITH SOLID BASS AND OVERALL CLARITY. THEY DID SEEM A LITTLE HARSH ON THE HIGH SIDE, BUT WERE VERY COMFORTABLE TO WEAR.  WHILE I LIKE THE OVERALL SOUND OF THESE EARPHONES, THEY ARE NOT QUITE AS SMOOTH AS MY JVC HA-DX3 EARPHONES, WHICH I CONSIDER THE VERY BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD.","excellent sound, can make your ears too warm. excellent sound, partially blocks external sound, very comfy for my large head, gets too warm during the summer, my ears get hot and sweaty, good for the winter.","Four Stars.

They sound great but the sound sealing for passive noise reduction is not good enough for flying. Great for open offices though.","I would recommend these headphones... I am not an expert on this but based on the quality of the output sound, I would definitely recommend these. I also have sennheisers at the same price and I felt Sony this was better than those head headphones. They are very comfortable on your head and you can wear them for hours without any problem.

This is a very good headphone. Comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring around.","Love them much. Other reviews are good.  I like these because they are supposedly flat.  I like my games and sound cards to do the adjusting of the sounds.  Good for music and games.  Interesting note, when my Dad did research and picked a pair of these in the 80's, he picked these also.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n*Update:  5 Stars for four years. After 4 years, the material of the ear cups is disintegrating. It comes off in black flecks on my head. The headphones are still good, however I've had to re-fabric them. Updated to 4 stars.","Great Comfort and Great Sound. I bought these after wearing a pair of $50 skullCandy Headphones for about 2 years. Wow there is a difference. These headphones seems to have crystal clear audio and a flat EQ. It's taking me a while to get use to them but I feel I will be able to create better mixes with these. They even cancel out sound pretty good.","its alright. good but missing sound you can't quite explain","The other reviews were correct.. I can't believe I got by for years without owning these, as a music lover.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI got chills right away the first time I cranked up some favorite tunes with these new (old) cans. (Well, new to me.)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe frequency response is supposedly 5-30K Hz. At this price point, you'd be hard pressed to find better, I should think.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGood seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while. GREAT sound.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nShort and sweet, well worth the cost.","Good Neutral Sound; fits bigger head. I'm listening to Linda Ronstadt singing, Someone to Watch Over Me, as I write this. The sound is clear. There is no overbearing bass, just enough, the high notes sparkle like NYE champagne, and, Linda's Voice is wonderful, fantastic. The headphones don't get in the way of the music.","Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case. The Koss PortaPro Headphones work for me as earbuds don't stay in place.  I use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality.  So far I haven't experienced any problems, I have had them over a month.","Great Headphones. I've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great.  Lifetime warranty, crisp sound, good base for portables, sturdy, comfortable.  Get them.","GREAT FOR FLYING. I am a tentative flyer and needed a good pair of headsets that would eliminate the noise of the plane, has great sound, and doesn't break the bank.  I use them with my iTouch and they are fantastic.  I bought some padded ear cushions thinking I would need them, but I didn't.  These are very comfortable.","Simply Amazing. Simply amazing is all i can say about these headphones. I think they are the best headphones for 100 or less. I have tried senns, sonys, skullcandys and numerous other brands and none sound as good as the porta pro's. the headphones really sound great, excellent actually. it is hard to beat these headphones, throw in the lifetime no questions ask warranty and it really is a no brainer. the only flaw i see is that it can at times pull your hair when taking them on\/off.","The MDRV6s are superior to the MDR7506. Had these headphones evaluated side by side with the Sony MDR7506. Twice. The MDRV6s are superior to the latter. They have more balanced, neutral, accurate range which is much better for quality music listening. The MDR7506, although also good, are overly bright, with less bass and thinner sound.","Kickin in the beat. These headphones are .....sleek....compact....durable....and most importantly do provide superior sound quality.  I got these instead of other pairs b\/c of all the fantabulous reviews on here, and they are pretty good. the sound really does sound perfect, and it has really really good bass, not too distorted, just enough to sound good.  plus, they come with a nice leather-esque carrying case with a rope on the top so you can cinch them up and take them anywhere.","Well worth the money. Finding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue ... until now. These are the real deal. The only point I give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord. It's long and somewhat bulky, but manageable. The sound reproduction, particularly at the bass end, is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfect.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDon't bother looking further. I've done it and tried most of them. I'd put these up against anything else, even more expensive brands, on the market.","Great Headphones. Fit is a little big.. I love these headphones. The sound is superb. Bass, Treble, etc... It's all super good. In the airplane they are just about noise canceling. The only beef I have with these is they are a little loose on the head. I'll take it though. I have used them with a Droid Phone, and I don't think they are quite loud enough sometimes. However, that is just the phones issue I bet.","These are one of the best headphones in their price range. These are one of the best headphones in their price range. Comfortable, killer sound, and reasonably closed (they don't isolate you entirely, which I think it's good).

I have flown overseas and worn them for hours at a time with no problem. They sound really good and for the price, I don't think you can beat em.","Descent sound for the price. I paid upper 70s on sale a couple of months ago. I think it's 10 to 15 less now.  They're worth $70 so if they've dropped in price then they're definitely worth it. Sound is good for digital stereo, but won't compare to a surround sound headphone. If all you need is stereo you won't be disappointed.","Good, but not fits my ears. The sound is pretty good. But it is not so comfortable when I use it for long time. (not fits)","Seems good on every aspect. As an armature to the hifi sound devices, I have no complain about it so far. It is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness, construction quality, sound quality and etc.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter retracted, the whole thing is bit of bulky. It is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack. Also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone. I'd rather to have a soft cloth bag for it.","Good overall but not for heavy bass likers. I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc. Excellent product on its own.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut this is not for someone who loves bass like me. I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy.","these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when .... Was using the v600s until they discontinued them. At this price point, these are a great substitute and sound very good in the club when I DJ.  There's definitely a break-in period and they sound even better after a few hours of use.","Good product with reasnable price. It's really a gud product and worth paying so much money for this. One thing that i noticed is it starts swaeting after couple of hours. This might a prob with me only. On the other hand it has a gud bass and sound quality. I recommend this product.","If Not For The Flaking.... They are the real deal. Studio quality. Bummer that the shiny top layer of the ear cushions flake off. Feels good, sounds good, collapses into a small package. Would buy again.","Very good headphone for the price!. I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price","My first. These provide a nice fit and good sound.  Sometimes I can hear background noise but I never used headphones so I cannot compare.","Happy with mine. Good set of cans for mixing and hearing they sound as it was recorded. If you want something for recreational music listening, these might not be for you thought I don't see why these couldn't be used for that.

I bought these during a special Amazon sale at half price.  They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I use these at night when I watch TV or movies in bed.  Last night was my first try with them.  I am very pleased with the quality of these headphones, but like a few others have noted in their reviews, after about an hour I found them uncomfortable.  I replaced another pair of Sony headphones that I've had for over 5 years and those were never uncomfortable.","Uncomfortable, mediocre sound, annoying cable. I used to think Sony MDRs were top of the heap. But these cheap headphones don't hold a candle to my Bose QC15s.

Pros -\r\r\r\nThe audio is good once you burn it for 50+ hrs, the build looks solid that will last years\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons -\r\r\r\nHeavy and uncomfortable. It presses hard on ears so you can't listen to for long time!\r\r\r\nI returned to to get more comfortable ones even though I got these ones at very good price 49$ from Amazon","Mediocre product.. Bought these for my husband who listens\/records music constantly. While they have a good sound quality, the material covering the ear phones part has begun to separate, exposing the padding inside the ear phone. We are disappointed in the quality of the product.","I thought it would sound amazing for it's price. After reading all the raving reviews, I thought it would sound amazing for it's price, but I thought it was mediocre. It didn't surprise me. it's not very good for an everyday carry either because of the way it's built.","Great headphones. Bought these for someone else as a gift and they felt and sounded so good I decided to keep them for myself.","Really good for editing and keeping out extraneous noise.. I use this for work cutting sound and music on an AVID. I am usually startled by people coming in my room because I can never hear them knock.","Great desk headphones!. Very good sounding headphones.  The build quality is great.  Not really for walking around in due to the long chord and bulky jack. These are great for my desk at work.  They block out all office noise.  The jack is so large that it sticks out of my pocket and the chord is so heavy, it dangles at my knees.  Minor gripe: the chord came slightly deformed from the packaging.","Blown away by these. Wow I had no idea how good these were til they came in. Blew my expectations out of the water and became one of my favorite headphones ever even over my Bose. great comfort; they run with a flat EQ so you will need a program to change the EQ settings for the sound to get that perfect sound.","Great for Rock and current pop, less so for classical. This headphone is especially good for rock, less so for classical.  It sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier. In that case, it goes very low, and has some slam in the bass.  Otherwise it lacks the slam and doesn't go as low. Rock vocals cut through with authority (try the Stones for a good experience!), as does electric guitar.  I haven't tried them with current pop, but my wife has, and she loves them.","Good, but go with the MDR7506 instead.. Has a sharp hissing quality to some of the high S sounds. Hardware is pretty much identical to the MDR7506 and some people say it sounds a bit different but still as good, but really the MDR7506 sounds better.","Great sound in a small package. These are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable.  I also own the Sennheiser PX100 which also sound great and are comfortable, but cost twice as much.  The Sennheisers fold down a bit smaller, but it's not a big difference.  The Koss Portapro is definitely a good quality product.  Good reviews from the audio experts, too.","terrific value. and terrific sound. You don't need to spend $200+ on the good doctor's  prescription :). These are a very wise, economical, and sound worthy choice.","Incredible sound.. These are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish. OK, they're ugly. That said, the sound is waaaay excellent. Get over it. Do you want sound better than 'phones costing 4 to 8 times this much or do you want to be stylish? At $32, you've really got to give them a try. Don't be misled by a few average ratings, because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites. I have a good music system, plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card, and these headphones rock on both.","Good quality OTH Headphones without the high price. These are quality headphones that are very well priced. They are comfortable and have decent sound reproduction for the price.","Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.

I can only say the quality it very good.  I have ears which approach a size only talked about in National Geographic.  So the one issue I have is the pads are too small.","What I found is when the source has good bass, it sounds awesome. One thing about this headphone is it reproduces the source faithfully.  Some people complained that the bass was weak. But most likely the source has weak bass to begin with.  What I found is when the source has good bass, it sounds awesome.  I played some Japanese Taiko music and it sounds like the floor is reverberating with each beat.  It is a really nice phone but is fairly unforgiving of the flaws in the source recording.","Nice Headsetf or the price.. Can't complain. These have good sound at a very reasonable price.

I wanted a set of headphones that were comfortable enough so I could wear them all day while editing, with great sound quality and durable enough to take in the field.  After talking with several others that have been working in production for years, the V6 kept coming up.  I love these headphones, they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!","Great sound, perfect fit. We're moving to an open floor plan at work to enhance \"collaboration\" which means it's going to get considerably louder and harder to concentrate.  I was looking for a decent pair of over the ear headphones and these rated pretty highly in my price range.  I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality - definitely a major improvement over the ear buds I was using before (standard issue iPhone 5 ear buds).","Very good headphone for the price!. I may not be a audiophile, but these headphones sound great! I was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone. Some may be put off by it, but I personally enjoy it. Don't be fool by the picture of the Portapro. They are quite thin and small when collapsed. These are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy. Overall, for the price, these are great sounding headphones for the price","Best headphones for the price. This is simply the best sounding headphones for under $100.  The bass is incredible, the sound is crispy clear.  When I commute in the train, I can hardly hear any noise, and the comfort is great.","Great headphones for the $$$. Sure, there are better and worse headphones out there, but, for the price, these are tough to beat imo. My son is a computer game fanatic, and I thought that he'd eventually want to upgrade from these. However, after two years of use, and replacing the worn out ear pads, he's still happy with their performance, to my surprise, as he often wants the latest, and greatest, but is still very satisfied with these. Hmmm, no wonder many radio stations around the country, use these as well, imo, they are a proven performer.","There Just Fine.

I probably have 10 different styles of headphones, Bose, Beats, in-ear style sport headphones, etc.  The sound on these rank above all of the others and the price is great!

Would definitely recommend and purchase again.","Sony delivers at a great price. I'm no audiophile, but I have been an amateur musician for the last 30 years. These headphones are an excellent choice for the price. Comfortable fit, brilliant highs, booming lows and middy mids - also very good ambient noise blocking. Even with no input I have to take them off to have a conversation. Overall - just another really great product from Sony. You can get much better cans than these, but not at this price.","Great for the price. Paid $67 on Amazon.  Bought these for my Dad for Christmas, along with an mp3 player.  Very good sound quality.  Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable.  Definetly recommended.","Best headphones for the price. I have owned two pairs of these since 1988.  They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then.  They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them.

These headphones work great. I use them with my Ipod touch and my laptop. They are light, extremely comfortable and have excellant sound.

I wanted a set of headphones that were comfortable enough so I could wear them all day while editing, with great sound quality and durable enough to take in the field.  After talking with several others that have been working in production for years, the V6 kept coming up.  I love these headphones, they are very comfortable and the sound quality is great.  I understand that the earmuffs flake after a while but at $12 to replace them I'm not worried.  I highly recommend these headphones!","Great Headphones. Great sound quality, great value. Highly recommend them. I used to break headphones all the time (1 pair every 6 months), now these have lasted me at least a year.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGreat value. Just buy them.","Koss portpro headphones. These things are good out of the. After they break in, they get even better. Solid bass, clean mids.\r\r\r\nThe highs are clean,but could use a little boost.

I can wear them for hours without discomfort.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut then, I try to pack them in my carryon to travel. They are so fragile feeling. Thin plastic. Plastic hinges.

The sound quality and the outside noise reduction are both very good.","these headphones combined with a good quality soundcard\/amp will work excellent as surround sound headphones ....

I use them mostly for gaming. I don't really like the coiled cable, but it works. They get hot and they are right on my head, but I can seriously block out the world when I have these on!","Amazing Price for Quality & Design. It does a nice job at noise reduction by virtually canceling out any sound. The padding fits well around the head, although the pair make for something like ear muffs if kept on too long. The design is great because it can be rolled up and stored in three different manners. A great pair to go with. I accidentally sat on the head phones and a connection cracked (hence the 4\/5 for durability)...but it comes with a 2 year optional warranty which is neat.","Good sound but not so perfect as of top Sennheiser ....

They aren't very comfortable, as they're very tight and the cushions are really crappy feeling. The range of motion is decent, not as good as Audio Technica though. Lack of removable cable is lame.

Very nice, solidly built headphones.\r\r\r\nThe sound quality is generally excellent, with deep base [e.g. double bases sound very solid and well defined] and smooth middle and highs.\r\r\r\nI use these with a Sansui Quad receiver and classical LPs and CDs.\r\r\r\nThe sound attenuation is impressive\/","Awesome but tight. I've been using these for gaming and for work. The sound quality is what you expect from Sennheiser so no complaints there. I do find that after an hour they start to feel too tight.

I bought them to replace a pair of sony headphones that had stopped working on me and I was really surprised by the quality for the money. These headphones are studio quality with great sound and the fit is very comfortable.","SENNHEISER HD-280 PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONES. The surround ear headphones are very comfortable to wear. The pads are firm enoungh to reduce most outside noise. I use this product for viewing HD, Std DVD and Cable broadcasts. The sound quality for highs tones are not high enough me. The mid and low tones frequencies are much better than expected.","Great headphones for a good price.. Everything about these headphones is good. They're comfortable, have a very decent cord, sound great, and are relatively inexpensive for their quality range. The first thing I listened to was Pink Floyd's \"Breath\", and at the very beginning, I didn't even realize that the pumping heartbeat was part of the music. I thought that I was hearing the blood pump through my ears in anticipation. The range is excellent.","Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. These headphones have a great sound quality for the price. They fit comfortably and can be folded for storage.\r\r\r\nI would have preferred a straight cable rather than the coiled cable which feels heavy and always seems as if it's pulling at the headphones when you're wearing them.","Worth it. If you have roommates or are up late and don't want to wake the house, then these are great.  They have good sound and are really comfortable.  I would probably get another of the same if these broke.  I work nights and have used these all night on a day off so I wouldn't wake others up.  I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound quality.  For the price, these are worth it.","Amazing sound quality. Amazing sound quality.

I have owned these for almost a year and I have to say these are the best headphones I've ever had (and I've tried Phillips, Bose and Sony). I sincerely believe that you will not find better for the price. Unfortunately, my pup chewed part of the ear off a few months after I got them but even after being held together by electrical tape they've held up very well. The cable is very durable, the padding is very comfortable and the sound quality is excellent.","Great Accurate Sound Reproduction. The Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones are very accurate headphones and have fantastic sound quality.  They do not color the sound like other headphones so they can be used as monitors for recording purposes. They are comfortable and fit securely while sealing out exterior noise.  Parts are replaceable which is a huge option that I have not seen offered by other brands.  These are not throw away headphones.  They are keepers!","Good for mixing. I wasn't blown away by the sound these produce but they make a good general quality sound...good enough for me to trust them during mixing.","Great Product. By far the best headphones you can buy for the price. I have owned multiple pairs of other name brand headphoens and not only did they not last as long they also lack aany apparent sound qualityimprovements. Keep in mind I am writing this over a year post purchase and have yet to have any issues. They come highly recommended","Very solid performance and value.. I gave it 4 stars because of the sound quality. It's good, but not great. Now, in terms of noise isolation, it's pretty good.

I'm not any kind of expert on headphones so I can't compare these.  The sound is great, I think.  I use them for audio when watching TV.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is they start to hurt my ears after an hour or so.  Not sure if others do this or not.\r\r\r\nThese phones are high quality and I'm sure will work for a long time.","and sound quality is great. However my unit was poorly made. The design, passive attenuation, and sound quality is great. However my unit was poorly made. One side did not work when it arrived.

I ordered a pair of these headphones after reading numerous reviews about how comfortable and great sounding they were. Unfortunately, one channel was dead no matter what source I plugged them into. I also was shocked at how stiff and uncomfortable the ear cushions were. My sony MDR 7506's actually feel better, I doubt I would have kept the sennheisers even if they worked.  Zzounds did send me a free-postage return label but it was close to a month that they sat on my $100","Great Headphones. Pros:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n-Comfortable\r\r\r\n-Clear, even, balanced sound\r\r\r\n-Great value for the price\r\r\r\n-Nice screw on 1\/4 inch adapter\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n-Due to the even response of these headphones, some may think they lack bass (I personally don't).\r\r\r\n-Not free?\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI have tried Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds, a Razer Carcharias headset, and some NuForce earbuds, none of those even come close to these as far as how clear and balanced the sounds are. The bass is incredibly tight and present when needed, but doesn't mess up the rest of the music like some other headphones do. Buy them! You won't regret it.","Great sound, like the passive noise reduction.. Bought these for work where the office can get a bit loud at times and I needed noise sound reduction.  I was using a pair of Grado SR80's but they let too much eternal noise come in (BTW, they sound very good). I actually like the sound of these better: not as warm but they are more accurate.  Despite the bulky look, they are light and very comfortable to wear.","These sound great but they do fit snug. These sound great but they do fit snug, and I have a normal size head. For $100 the sound quality is there, but the adjustment feature could be better.","Great headphones, but why does everything have to use so much plastic?. The sound quality is great. I can wear them for hours without discomfort.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut then, I try to pack them in my carryon to travel. They are so fragile feeling. Thin plastic. Plastic hinges. WHY??\r\r\r\nFew companies make quality products anymore.","Great sound\/cable, mediocre ear pieces.. This is my second pair of these headphones I've bought. They sound great and have a great screw in adapter for the plug. the reason for 3 stars is that its not very comfortable to wear on the ears. There is a lot of pressure and the padding on the ear pieces is not super comfortable. I can do maybe a half hour in these before I have to take them off for a while which isn't great when I'm tracking for a good portion of the day.","Five Stars. Great sound, dynamic range. Excellent value for money. As good as any high end headphones.","Probably great, uneven sound is distributed. They are alright. They might be worth 5, but I just got these today and the right side is louder than the left and aren't very clear. For 70 they are nice but the uneven sound bothers me.

That said, these headphones combined with a good quality soundcard\/amp will work excellent as surround sound headphones! I have had many gaming headsets including the Astros A40's. The Sennheiser HD 280 pro is my preferred wired gaming headset when used with a amp and external mic! A great all around headphone!","Great sound, quality build. I have been very impressed by these. I use them mostly for gaming. I don't really like the coiled cable, but it works. They get hot and they are right on my head, but I can seriously block out the world when I have these on!","Amazing Price for Quality & Design. It does a nice job at noise reduction by virtually canceling out any sound. The padding fits well around the head, although the pair make for something like ear muffs if kept on too long. The design is great because it can be rolled up and stored in three different manners. A great pair to go with. I accidentally sat on the head phones and a connection cracked (hence the 4\/5 for durability)...but it comes with a 2 year optional warranty which is neat.","Great. Shipped fast, works perfect and save us time from having to go to the store! Will defiantly order again. Thanks!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nUse these to mix and master (reference).. they offer a nice flat true sound!","Phenomal sound at a great price.. Pros:\r\r\r\n- Phenomenal sound quality, even for being one of the cheapest Sennheisers available.\r\r\r\n- Amazing sound quality\r\r\r\n- Excellent at filtering out external sound\r\r\r\n- Long, coiled cord\r\r\r\n- Fits my large head great\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n- Ear surrounds seal out outside sound, as well as air. Ears can feel weird after wearing these for an extended (1+ hours) time.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWould I recommend to a friend? Yes.","Oh my God! These are amazing.. For the price, there are no better headphones out there. Nice fit (I don't have big hair) and great sound. I'm sure that there are headphones out there that sound better, but they are twice or three times the price, possibly more. You will not be disappointed.

Very good flat response--using bass and treble controls on my Fisher tube amp at midpoints. (I am not using headphones amp.) Very complete frequency range response. You can hear minute details in music and voice. Very good isolation from external room noise.  Comfortable and stay put. You would have to buy speakers costing thousands to get sound this good.","Nice headphones. These are very clean sounding headphones.  I didn't have another pair of headphones to compare them to, so I can't give it a 5 star rating, but the sound quality is great (best coverage of the audio spectrum for the price) and they fit tightly but comfortably\r\r\r\nover the ears.  I was especially impressed by how well they reproduce the low end of some of my Korg Triton Extreme's synth sounds, yet were not muddy sounding.","For the price these did not sound that great, even with an amp. For the price these did not sound that great, even with an amp.  Plus after listening to them for about 10 minutes my ears would start to sweat and they would hurt.  I returned them and bought the Beyerdynamic DT770.  They are a much better quality headphone.","Great Headphones. I was looking for pair of noise-canceling headphones that didn't require batteries and wanted something much cheaper than the Bose.  These headphones met that criteria and they are built well for a 7-year old to handle.  The sound is excellent, even while sitting on a noisy plane, so no complaints there.  However, I don't really like how far the part that goes over your head sticks out on the sides, and the comfort and lightness are not quite up there with the Bose I've tried, but then again neither is the price.","Four Stars. Good sound isolation, but ears do get warm after30-60 minutes. Great sound!","Sennheiser 5 Stars. Have had a couple of headphones and that has endured weekly use and setups for over a year.  Great sound and quality.  Will be doing a review on YouTube with our other gear via Legendary Street Soccer.  We endorse and look to Sennheiser for our next upgrade.","Great sound, but UNCOMFORTABLE!. I have to agree with many of the reviewers who have given these earphones low marks for comfort -- the sound is great, but it just doesn't make up for the fact that the ear pads are very hard and they really aren't large enough to cover the ear.  Very uncomfortable to use for more than about 30 minutes or so.  I am very disappointed, especially after reading the many GOOD reviews.  These people must have really small, really hard heads.","Not Great, But Worth the Money. Took some getting use to, because I'm accustomed to a brighter, more detailed sound. But the warmth and creaminess makes for a pleasant listening experience. Older analog recordings sound better with these cans as it masks the imperfections and smoothens everything out. Not really good for the studio where definition and detail are paramount. Good upgrade for those coming out of cheap headsets.","Good sound but grips the head too tightly. Great sound, but I didn't realize these grip the head so tightly when I ordered them online. Or maybe I just have a big skull?","great quality sound at a low price. I got these on sale and they usually go for 100+ dollars from what I can tell (circa 2013).  They are great and I use them practically every day. My head is huge, so they fit a little tight, but not so much that I feel uncomfortable.","over all good, not for active people. purchased these after reading a lot of reviews. choice was between senn. 280 pro or the 595's. I wanted to wear these while snowboarding or going to the gym, let me say there a whole lot bulkier then i thought. strictly made for home use, or travel. the sound qaulity is great and songs sound so much better then you thought. this being my first set of nice headphones i cant say too much.","These headphones are amazing! I bought them to replace a pair of .... These headphones are amazing! I bought them to replace a pair of sony headphones that had stopped working on me and I was really surprised by the quality for the money. These headphones are studio quality with great sound and the fit is very comfortable.","Headphones to sample music by. Tight on the ear after about 15 minutes. Have it adjusted all the way to its maximum. Great sound though!","The fit is very tight, and clamps hard on the ears.. I received one of these with some packaging issues, and returned it--Amazon's great for that, of course, but I do have to echo the comments of others here. I tried these on. They sound fine, but fit very poorly. I have a hard time imagining men--or women with hair, as it were--feeling comfortable wearing these. The fit is very tight, and clamps hard on the ears. Maybe they loosen up over time, but this is a fixable issue, and Sennheiser should get on it.","Great headphones for a good price.. Everything about these headphones is good. They're comfortable, have a very decent cord, sound great, and are relatively inexpensive for their quality range. The first thing I listened to was Pink Floyd's \"Breath\", and at the very beginning, I didn't even realize that the pumping heartbeat was part of the music. I thought that I was hearing the blood pump through my ears in anticipation. The range is excellent.","Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. These headphones have a great sound quality for the price. They fit comfortably and can be folded for storage.\r\r\r\nI would have preferred a straight cable rather than the coiled cable which feels heavy and always seems as if it's pulling at the headphones when you're wearing them.","HD-280. The HD-280 did excatly as promised, great sound and confort while blocking out external noise.  I would highly recommend these headphones.","Worth it. If you have roommates or are up late and don't want to wake the house, then these are great.  They have good sound and are really comfortable.  I would probably get another of the same if these broke.  I work nights and have used these all night on a day off so I wouldn't wake others up.  I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound quality.  For the price, these are worth it.","Great headphones!. Great headphones, let it run for atleast 100 hours, (aka burn-in) effect, then it sounds very good.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOnly thing i do not like, it is very uncomfortable, very tight on the head. Hope Sennheiser will some design review on these headphones.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOther than that it is great!","Great Accurate Sound Reproduction. The Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones are very accurate headphones and have fantastic sound quality.  They do not color the sound like other headphones so they can be used as monitors for recording purposes. They are comfortable and fit securely while sealing out exterior noise.  Parts are replaceable which is a huge option that I have not seen offered by other brands.  These are not throw away headphones.  They are keepers!","Great mid-price headphone. Comfortable fit, great sound, fairly light-weight.  I'm very happy with the purchase.","Great Product. By far the best headphones you can buy for the price. I have owned multiple pairs of other name brand headphoens and not only did they not last as long they also lack aany apparent sound qualityimprovements. Keep in mind I am writing this over a year post purchase and have yet to have any issues. They come highly recommended","Very solid performance and value.. I gave it 4 stars because of the sound quality. It's good, but not great. Now, in terms of noise isolation, it's pretty good. I use it for drumming and it fits me well.","Very nice. I'm not any kind of expert on headphones so I can't compare these.  The sound is great, I think.  I use them for audio when watching TV.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is they start to hurt my ears after an hour or so.  Not sure if others do this or not.\r\r\r\nThese phones are high quality and I'm sure will work for a long time.","Great Headphones. I have a set of Bose QC 15's and these sound as good if not better. The around the ear muffs do a good job of noise isolation. The sound is great with no distortion. The cord is very long and I am concerned about the weight of the cord causing premature failure at the connecting end as I leave these attached to my laptop all the time and the cord is hanging unsupported. I highly recommend these for the price.","and sound quality is great. However my unit was poorly made. The design, passive attenuation, and sound quality is great. However my unit was poorly made. One side did not work when it arrived. There was what appeared to be a bad trace or connection which prevented that speaker from working. A little soldering fixed it but still. Only reason I give it three stars is that the design made it easy to fix.","Large, work well. I've had these for almost a year now with no problems. I bought them mainly for use when traveling, or anytime I want people to know I don't want to be bothered. They work. They are quite large, which should be expected with this type of headphone. The size does make my ears tired after a long flight. Great cord length. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is great as well. Try on before a long term commitment. Star deducted on behalf of my ears."]},{"ngram":"good sound","count":63,"ngram_comments":["good sound, not durable. I have no complaints about the sound quality of these headphones.

Decent sound isolation-adequate for field recording.  Strong but slightly exaggerated and slightly mushy bass. Not the greatest treble detail.  I bought these to replace an old pair of Sony MDR-V6's and after listening for quite a while concluded that the Sony's have much more accurate bass and treble. Not really adequate for critical monitoring. They really clamp your head pretty hard.","nice. Good sound quality. I've never had any surprises working with these and then hearing it on a big sound system. I'm pretty sensitive to head pressure and I can wear these for hours without a headache, though they are snug. I have a smallish woman head though. I've carried them around somewhat irresponsibly in my backpack and though they are big they are durable for portability.","sound quality is pretty good, and this could just be because the .... sound quality is pretty good, and this could just be because the headphone's new, but the headphones clamp down on the head too tight, making it uncomfortable to wear it for a long time.

I don't have a lot of experience with over-the-ear headphones but these meet and exceed all of my expectations. The full earcup design eliminates most of the unwanted outside noise yet are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Frequency response is spot on with crystal clear highs; full, warm mid-range, and plenty of deep, rich bass without sounding artificially enhanced. My music never sounded so good. I find myself running the EQ flatter than normal because these headphones don't require boosting certain frequencies - very flat response.","Good sound, but they hurt your head. The width between my wears is not more than average.  But if you wear these for more than about an hour (say playing a video game so that your spouse doesn't get upset with all of the booms and crashes) your ears will ache.  The sound is very good but you just can't wear them that long.","CLAMPING TORTURE DEVICE. This is the most uncomfortable headphone I've ever worn.

Sounded good until the left side stopped working in under a week.  Returned them .","so far so good.... I've used all the \"major\" brands of dj headphones and so far these are proving to hold up well. Definitely a different sound than the rest (a bit less bass-heavy).

Good for airplane or loud locations. Blocked out a lot of noise. Did not have to increase volume. Cheap alternative to noise canceling types. Sound is a little muddy.","They're good, but not quite as good as people have .... I dreamed of getting these for such a long time. They're good, but not quite as good as people have said. The pad that runs across the top can come off and it really sucks to get it back on there. The fit really squeezes your head, which is part of what helps them sound good.

On listening to classical music the sounds of the individual instrument were not clear. Dynamic range and frequency response were good but not exceptional","Meh, overpriced. After having these a while, I can say they aren't really spectacular sounding, but the noise isolation is good. Only thing is that I have a stand-up desk, so either the obscene weight of the cord is pulling on one side of my head, or if you try to route it through the desk the cord doesn't want to stay put anywhere and it ends up pulling at your head anyway.","not for amateurs. good sound but way to heavy.

They have good sound and are really comfortable.  I would probably get another of the same if these broke.  I work nights and have used these all night on a day off so I wouldn't wake others up.  I'm not an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound quality.  For the price, these are worth it.","Great headphones!. Great headphones, let it run for atleast 100 hours, (aka burn-in) effect, then it sounds very good.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOnly thing i do not like, it is very uncomfortable, very tight on the head. Hope Sennheiser will some design review on these headphones.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOther than that it is great!","Uncomfortable. I needed closed-ear headphones for noise isolation (working in a lab) and also good sound. These model has both. The ambient noise was reduced significantly (equipment noise, people talking). The sound was very good, noticeably better than my cheaper HD-515. Other nice things are a coiled cord, decent materials and design.\r\r\r\nHowever these headphones are very uncomfortable because of the pressure on the head. Plus I wear glasses so be aware that this may be a factor. I tried them in different positions for a couple of hours, then finally gave up with a huge headache. Will be returning, unfortunately.","Good for mixing. I wasn't blown away by the sound these produce but they make a good general quality sound...good enough for me to trust them during mixing.","Yes.. These headphones sounds really good for the price. The bass is boomy just like you want it, but doesn't overpower the mids or the treble. Just try them on some jazz or Nujabes. You can hear everything. My main genre of choice is metal and it works perfect for that too.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe soundstage isn't huge but it's better than IEMs for sure.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey fold up nicely, and aren't uncomfortable at all.","If something would happen to these I would buy Sennheiser again.. These provide good sound and are durable!","Very solid performance and value.. I gave it 4 stars because of the sound quality. It's good, but not great. Now, in terms of noise isolation, it's pretty good. I use it for drumming and it fits me well.","Great Headphones. I have a set of Bose QC 15's and these sound as good if not better. The around the ear muffs do a good job of noise isolation. The sound is great with no distortion. The cord is very long and I am concerned about the weight of the cord causing premature failure at the connecting end as I leave these attached to my laptop all the time and the cord is hanging unsupported. I highly recommend these for the price.","Comfy and Compatible. The HD 280 Pro headphones are comfortable and passively block outside sound.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe 64 Ohms resistance is low enough to work with all my devices.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThere's no volume adjuster on the cable or headphones, which is good, since those tend to break on me.","The ear cushions cover my whole ear and are actually pretty comfortable. I would not get these for taking .... These headphones sound very clear and crisp. The ear cushions cover my whole ear and are actually pretty comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI would not get these for taking around outside though because they look kind of funny on.

I liked the sound produced by these headphones but the severe clamping force made them quite uncomfortable after only a short period of time.  I tried stretching them out over a soccer ball for about 5 days and they felt a bit better but not by much.  Maybe they would feel better with a longer period of stretching (say a month) but they were a gift so I did not have more time to experiment.

Frequency response is spot on with crystal clear highs; full, warm mid-range, and plenty of deep, rich bass without sounding artificially enhanced. My music never sounded so good. I find myself running the EQ flatter than normal because these headphones don't require boosting certain frequencies - very flat response.","CLAMPING TORTURE DEVICE.

Good sound, and fairly decent noise cancellation...although nowhere near what one would consider \"top rate\" in that department (noise cancelling).  But they get the job done, and are fairly comfortable for wearing long hours.","Great for Video Production & Editing. These headphones are perfect for those who work in professional video. They cancel enough noise to use in the field and are built like a tank. They are also ideal for editing because of their flat response giving you the most accurate mix for monitoring.

The HD-280 are excellent headphones for a reasonable price.  The sound reproduction is true professional quality.","Do not hesitate to buy these HD280 Pro.. Very near to a religious experience.  Truly.  They are that good. And I am only listening to MP3.  I can only imagine how astounding they would be with true source music.","Perfect for mixing duties. I have a small electronic music studio, but I live in a shared house and can't run monitor speakers.. been using HD280 Pro cans forever, do I bought them again when my old ones died.  Great, flat reproduction, perfect for mixing and finalization.  I hope Sennheiser never stops making these!","... headphones are form fitting to my head which I like, old school looking is what I like growing .... Sennheiser HD-280 PRO headphones are form fitting to my head which I like, old school looking is what I like growing up in the late 70's early 80's, they sound great, would recommend for sure but everybody hears differently, what sounds good to me may not to you....nevertheless they are Sennheiser's need I say more?","these headphones combined with a good quality soundcard\/amp will work excellent as surround sound headphones .... Really accurate studio sound quality headphones! Definitely not for those looking for an exaggerated colored sound out of the box. That said, these headphones combined with a good quality soundcard\/amp will work excellent as surround sound headphones! I have had many gaming headsets including the Astros A40's. The Sennheiser HD 280 pro is my preferred wired gaming headset when used with a amp and external mic! A great all around headphone!","Great traditional closed headphones.. <a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sennheiser-HD-280-Professional-Headphones\/dp\/B000065BPB\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones<\/a>\r\r\r\nI had to order a second set because first had a faulty cable--perhaps not fully tested before packaging at factory.  Very good flat response--using bass and treble controls on my Fisher tube amp at midpoints. (I am not using headphones amp.) Very complete frequency range response. You can hear minute details in music and voice. Very good isolation from external room noise.  Comfortable and stay put. You would have to buy speakers costing thousands to get sound this good.","over all good, not for active people. purchased these after reading a lot of reviews. choice was between senn. 280 pro or the 595's. I wanted to wear these while snowboarding or going to the gym, let me say there a whole lot bulkier then i thought. strictly made for home use, or travel. the sound qaulity is great and songs sound so much better then you thought. this being my first set of nice headphones i cant say too much.","Comfortable to wear. These things hurt my ears, MUSICALLY!!! Comfortable to wear, but the audio sounded like it was coming out of a tin can. Awful sound reproduction. I returned these and bought the Audio Technica ATH M50X. I compared the Sennheiser HD 280 and Audio Technicas to the same MP3 player. A Zune MP3 player and a professional Wheatstone broadcast audio mixer.  I did not touch any EQ settings. The Audio Technica ATH M50's sounded so nice and smooth. The technical specs for both headphones are not consistent and not complete. Impedance mismatch??? Not sure.","SENNHEISER HD-280 PROFESSIONAL HEADPHONES. The surround ear headphones are very comfortable to wear. The pads are firm enoungh to reduce most outside noise. I use this product for viewing HD, Std DVD and Cable broadcasts. The sound quality for highs tones are not high enough me. The mid and low tones frequencies are much better than expected.","Fine Headphones. I bought these for a friend, but I am certain that he likes them. He liked the ones we have, which are Identical to the HD-280 Pro Headphones by Sennheiser.","Natural Sounding. These HD 280 Pro headphones are comparable to Sony MDR-7510. The audio is clean and neutral. Audio detail comes out clean but the bass is a little bit dry. I'm told in time the bass will get fuller with use.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHD 280 Pro headphones are good for any audio with fine detail. Also, if your mixing these are sound accurate.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can recommend these headphones.","Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. These headphones have a great sound quality for the price. They fit comfortably and can be folded for storage.\r\r\r\nI would have preferred a straight cable rather than the coiled cable which feels heavy and always seems as if it's pulling at the headphones when you're wearing them.","HD-280. The HD-280 did excatly as promised, great sound and confort while blocking out external noise.  I would highly recommend these headphones.","Great Accurate Sound Reproduction. The Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones are very accurate headphones and have fantastic sound quality.  They do not color the sound like other headphones so they can be used as monitors for recording purposes. They are comfortable and fit securely while sealing out exterior noise.  Parts are replaceable which is a huge option that I have not seen offered by other brands.  These are not throw away headphones.  They are keepers!","Comfy and Compatible. The HD 280 Pro headphones are comfortable and passively block outside sound.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe 64 Ohms resistance is low enough to work with all my devices.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThere's no volume adjuster on the cable or headphones, which is good, since those tend to break on me."]},{"ngram":"would recommend","count":11,"ngram_comments":["Great sound for the money. Sound is pretty darn good on these! They don't have extreme bass, but the sound is \"right\" - not like a lot of headphones that put an emphasis on bass, but neglect the rest. Very balanced. Highly recommended! I would also recommend a headphone amp for these if you have a weak output, like my Dell laptop.","CLAMPING TORTURE DEVICE. This is the most uncomfortable headphone I've ever worn. Good isloation, good material and decent sound quality. But very very uncomfortable. Would not recommend to anyone who is looking to wear these for a long period of time. 2 out of 5.","Great Headphones. Great headphones. Great sound isolation, accurate sound reproduction.\r\r\r\nThey're also build very well, would recommend to anybody that needs a pair of headphones for a studio setting.","Good - met review expectations. I really like these headphones, I purchased them based on a recommendation from my son as he also has them.  I like them and they met every expectation I had. I would definitely recommend them to others, the only thing I wish they had was a bag for transport.","Bought for Hubbie. He is thrilled.  Said the sound is amazing! Clear, crisp and comfortable.  He would recommend this headset to all of his friends.","Tight sound but so is the fit. I liked the sound produced by these headphones but the severe clamping force made them quite uncomfortable after only a short period of time.  I tried stretching them out over a soccer ball for about 5 days and they felt a bit better but not by much.  Maybe they would feel better with a longer period of stretching (say a month) but they were a gift so I did not have more time to experiment.  Given this condition, I would only recommend this headphone to people with very small heads..","Amazing for price. I've used them on HD TV\/stereo system for 2 years and they have handled dropping, walking on, kicking, yanking out with foot and daily use watching TV in quiet mode. Better than my HD stereo system with 5 speakers.\r\r\r\nI'm totally amazed and would like to get another pair but my 30 year old Nikko won't die.\r\r\r\nVery nice head fit on both wife's and my head, several hours at a time. Nicely adjustable, no breaking or cracking, or splitting.\r\r\r\nIdeal headset for the use.\r\r\r\nI'm very pleased and would recommend them... actually have recommended them several times.","... headphones are form fitting to my head which I like, old school looking is what I like growing ....

Pros:\r\r\r\n- Phenomenal sound quality, even for being one of the cheapest Sennheisers available.\r\r\r\n- Amazing sound quality\r\r\r\n- Excellent at filtering out external sound\r\r\r\n- Long, coiled cord\r\r\r\n- Fits my large head great\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\n- Ear surrounds seal out outside sound, as well as air. Ears can feel weird after wearing these for an extended (1+ hours) time.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWould I recommend to a friend? Yes.","HD-280. The HD-280 did excatly as promised, great sound and confort while blocking out external noise.  I would highly recommend these headphones.","Would recommend. After few years, it's still going strong and no broken piece yet. I use it to watch a movie on my TV with wireless transmitter.\r\r\r\nWould recommend"]},{"ngram":"noise cancelling","count":8,"ngram_comments":["Perfect for noisy office.. I bought these for use in my noisy office and even though they are not \"noise cancelling\" they do a great job of it! They are also very comfortable to wear and sound great.","The sound is great on this headset. The sound is great on this headset.and the only reason I gave it a 4star is because the way its design..its a little too bulky for my head...otherwise sound is great and noise cancelling is superb.","Amazing Sound at a Fair Price. I was using an old $40 pair of noise-cancelling headphones for podcast recording, and I had no idea how bad I really had it.  These babies are an entirely different world on an entirely different level, and I'm told they compete SOUNDLY with far more expensive sets.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWhy would you spend two hundred bucks on a junk pair of Beats if you're keeping them at your computer desk?  Save money and get these badboys for WAY better sound.","Five Stars. These headphones work well for basic recording and for cancelling out outside noise when listening to music.","Good headphones. These headphones were just as described.  Good sound, and fairly decent noise cancellation...although nowhere near what one would consider \"top rate\" in that department (noise cancelling).  But they get the job done, and are fairly comfortable for wearing long hours.","Very good. There is only one reason I do not put 5 starts on it, and maybe I am wrong, but to me, with 5-stars noise-cancelling headphones I should not hear conversations going on around me without any music on.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nUsing these headphones and some light (but continuous) music, you should not hear any conversations going on around you, that deserves 4 stars.","Pretty Good Phones. I bought these just to hear what a good set of passive phones would do, compared to a good set of active noise-cancelling headphones like the Audio-Technica. Turns out that for me, at least, there is no comparison.  There's nothing wrong with the Sennheisers, but their claimed 32 DB (passive) noise reduction is not anywhere as good in practice as the AT. When I listen in my noisy apartment, with the typical airco and refrigerator and washer\/dryer running, I hear a lot of rumble with the Sennheisers but the AT tunes it all out.","Really awesome wired headphones. Seriously, the sound on these are incredible. Truly noise cancelling. Also has really nice base. I absolutely love these headphones!"]}]},{"comments":[{"comment_id":2068,"comment":"Too much static, poor head fit..

Work really good. Sound quality is great. Now I can play my pc games in peace and my wife can watch her TV without blaring the audio.","Not good for laying down. Sound quality is good and so is the range for a large bedroom. However I take off 2 stars because they slip off easily and aren't comfortable to wear while laying down.","Good for night TV watching. The sound quality is good, and they feel very comfortable. I can fall asleep on your back and wake up without  ear pain.","Decent sound, mediocre transmission\/reception. These headphones provide Sennheiser audio quality, but FM static and interference. Not even just FM, but poor FM reception. As soon as the headphones move two meters or so from the receiver, static and hissing regularly interrupt the audio. So, for users who plan never to stray more than a meter or 1.5 meters from the transmitter with their headphones, these might warrant a four star rating. For everyone else, it's hard to warrant a high rating when otherwise good audio is made awful by poor wireless transmission.","Augmentation for old ears.... Although I bought this set of headphones for my mother-in-law, I think that I will enjoy using it myself.  The sound quality is much better than that from my previous pair.","Great sound for all!!. This was returned because we would have needed another piece of equipment to place on the TV to work.  Also when sitting next to my partner, I could hear the sound.  The quality of the sound was great.","Nice clear strong sound.. Nice quality, great sound, very little static, and works anywhere in the house. Doesn't mute the TV when in use. Exactly what I wanted. A little uncomfortable when used for long periods of time.","Perfect for anything tv related. I game and stream all the time, my father also likes to watch sports on the surround sound setup every night around the same time, I bought him these and they've not had a single pickup ever. Even after hundreds of hours of listing. The sound quality is quite good for this price point, the highs are slightly harsh but never distort and the open back nature allows a nice wide sound stage.","Sounds good to me. Keeps the sound of what I'm viewing on TV away from my wife.  That's it's only use for me. The sound quality is good, and I'm quite happy with my purchase.","Good quality, once you get it working.. Took way more work to get it set up than necessary. But once I did, worked great. Sound is very good. The next great test is to see if we can run two headphones off it at the same time.","Headphones Very Uncomfortable and Sound Quality a Huge Disappointment. These are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever tried!  And the sound quality of the unit is terrible.  AND, when you turn up the volume on the tv, it cause the headphones to have a hollow, echoing sound!  ...Very disappointed in this product and I strongly recommend you do not buy it - you will end up returning it.  I think you have to pay about twice as much to get a quality headphone.","Four Stars. Works well sound quality isn't what Id expect from Sennheiser.","Sennheuiser RF Headphones. Comfortable headset, good sound quality, fair price. I have some hearing loss coupled with poor TV speakers made viewing difficult. This product makes viewing 100% better","Nifty. Love these, very handy. Not the best sound quality for music. Good for audiobooks and the like.","Nice sound quality. Nice sound quality, but it sometimes fades out of tune and needs to be adjusted. Also it can sound like an AM radio at times if you get out of tune or out of range. If you like putting a microwave up to your head you might want to just get a 2.4Ghz version.","Terrible sound quality. Sound quality is worse than a cheap pair of USB headphones I have.  There's a constant hiss and low frequencies are weak.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe worst thing is you actually have to manually tune the headset to the best radio frequency.  It reminds me of a 1960s transistor radio.  I never could get rid of the hiss.","buy these, they are great. I don't know what some other reviewers were saying about problems getting these to work. I took it out of the box and plugged it in to charge. I connected to smart tv with RCA plugs, turned headphones on, and that was total install. No tv adjustments or anything. Sound quality is excellent. Headphones are comfortable but will slip if I look down. Definitely not too tight.","Good quality, depends on application.. As far as these type of headsets go, I guess these are good.  The sound quality is good but they allow too much noise to escape them while listening.  It defeats the purpose a bit since I was hoping to use these in the bedroom while my wife is sleeping or vise versa.  Also, if you pause what you're watching for too long, you get extremely loud white noise\/hissing coming from the headphones.","Forget the bluetooth earbuds.. We are senior citizens and I used to turn up the volume on the TV for my wife.  We tried a number of other option including bluetooth earbuds but this is the one that worked best.  I usually get up early and can listen to the TV without disturbing anyone else with speaker sound.  We both love the sound quality.","Line of sight audio. Main reason I purchased these was because of the price point and the name. Well truth be told you got to be pretty close to get good sound quality. Overall not such a great product. Switch positioning are also in a very bad place.","Great Value & Sound. These have been in use for almost one year, less a month. sound quality is rock sold Sennheiser. Signal goes in and out in some areas of the home, but good for the $$ and not a huge issue.  Getting good time between charges. I use them at night. My hearing is shot thanks to rock shows in the '70s, 80s, 90, ect., so it's nice to hear details and dialog easily. I'd buy them again.","A lot of headphones for the money without sacrificing quality!. I've been a Sennheiser fan for years. The headphones I always used the RS130 model which they no longer make so I decided to try the RS120 model. Much to my surprise they work and sound just as good as the RS130's which have surround sound.  These 120's sound clear and I don't hear any hissing or humming. I recommend these highly and a bargain at the price!","\"on the ear\" isn't my thing. Sennheiser makes high quality products.  This one is pretty good, but clearly not top shelf.  The sound quality is average.  As well, the \"on the ear\" style is apparently not my thing.  It kind of hurts my ears a bit.  I'd much rather have a set of \"over the ear\" headphones.","Great Sound & Price!. I purchased this headset as a refurb for about half the normal retail cost. When I received my unit it looked immaculate - just like a new unit. The range is incredible and the sound quality overall is great. The ear \"muffs\" are very comfortable too. I am very pleased with this purchase.","Two Stars. Bulky but sound quality is very good...then they quit working after a few months.","Very comfortable. Easy to charge. Very comfortable.

I have been really impressed with this wireless headphone set. They're extremely comfortable to wear. And the sound quality is about as close to perfect as a headset can get.

Was really disappointed when it stopped broadcasting after ONLY 2.5 years. The charging light works, so its not the charger. The green light indicating broadcast is out, and all I get is static. When I tried to adjust the tuning dial, still from top to bottom, all I got was static. It's a shame it quit, I'm a regular customer who bought many Sennheiser products...won't be buying these RF headphones again from them.","Good quality, once you get it working.. Took way more work to get it set up than necessary. But once I did, worked great. Sound is very good. The next great test is to see if we can run two headphones off it at the same time.","Sennheuiser RF Headphones. Comfortable headset, good sound quality, fair price. I have some hearing loss coupled with poor TV speakers made viewing difficult. This product makes viewing 100% better","Nifty. Love these, very handy. Not the best sound quality for music. Good for audiobooks and the like.","Good headphones.. Bought this because I like watching movies on TV and wife likes to read.  She can't read when she overhears the audio from my shows.  So I gave in and bought this product.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGood sound.  Plenty of volume if needed (I use about 1\/3 volume).  Enough treble to hear conversations.","good sound. I just wish they made wireless ear .... These are working very well, good sound. I just wish they made wireless ear buds so you could lay sideways on your pillow with them on.","This is it.. Works as advertised. Thank you.  Good clear rich sound.","Great so far!. Just received this today.  Was easy to set up without actually reading the directions.  Easy to quickly grab headphones to put on.  No unplugging any cords or pressing buttons to get it started.  Ear cups are not as comfy as previous models and just sort of sit flat over your ears.  Sound of the tv is very good and seems very clear.","Good quality, depends on application.. As far as these type of headsets go, I guess these are good.  The sound quality is good but they allow too much noise to escape them while listening.  It defeats the purpose a bit since I was hoping to use these in the bedroom while my wife is sleeping or vise versa.  Also, if you pause what you're watching for too long, you get extremely loud white noise\/hissing coming from the headphones.","Good sound - terrible design.. I both like and HATE these headphones. The sound is very good, the big problem is the darn things won't stay on my head. The very slightest movement or tilt of my head and they FALL OFF.  No matter how I adjust them, that is the one that slides  up and down but that doesn't allow any tightening. Had they made the cushions over the ear instead of on the ear they would fit much better.","Line of sight audio. Main reason I purchased these was because of the price point and the name. Well truth be told you got to be pretty close to get good sound quality. Overall not such a great product. Switch positioning are also in a very bad place.","Good sound, great range. Good sound, great range. The one issue is they are not comfortable after several hours. Stop using them at work for this reason.","Great headphones -- wireless. Good frequency response.. These headphones are bad a$$. Sound is awesome. No wires. A lot of different options to hook into your TV or souround system.","Great Value & Sound. These have been in use for almost one year, less a month. sound quality is rock sold Sennheiser. Signal goes in and out in some areas of the home, but good for the $$ and not a huge issue.  Getting good time between charges. I use them at night. My hearing is shot thanks to rock shows in the '70s, 80s, 90, ect., so it's nice to hear details and dialog easily. I'd buy them again.","A lot of headphones for the money without sacrificing quality!. I've been a Sennheiser fan for years. The headphones I always used the RS130 model which they no longer make so I decided to try the RS120 model. Much to my surprise they work and sound just as good as the RS130's which have surround sound.  These 120's sound clear and I don't hear any hissing or humming. I recommend these highly and a bargain at the price!","\"on the ear\" isn't my thing. Sennheiser makes high quality products.  This one is pretty good, but clearly not top shelf.  The sound quality is average.  As well, the \"on the ear\" style is apparently not my thing.  It kind of hurts my ears a bit.  I'd much rather have a set of \"over the ear\" headphones.","Two Stars. Bulky but sound quality is very good...then they quit working after a few months.","Sound great!. Sound great!\r\r\r\nRevised - sound is good, but seems to have a lot of interference and is difficult to tune the frequency.","Major improvement in TV sound.. Really make a difference in listening to TV shows.  All the dialog is distinctly clear and the stereo sound is much better than even my surround sound system with very good speakers (Bose).  Sometimes when adjusting the volume, you can accidently move the Tuning control and lose all sound completely.  Just be careful.  The headphone stand is a little awkward and you have to be careful to make sure that the charging LED comes on or they are not being recharged.","Excellent reception - Good Fidelity - Good Value-Good at Spouse Blocking.

Ggreat sound but they keep slipping off my head, no way to adjust them for tightness. rang the company and they were no help with the problem. Maybe I need velcro on my ears.","Good product work as expected. Connected it today comes with long sound cord for me to connect from one side of my 71 tv to the other side audio out. did need to adjust the tune on speaker and on base due to static at first but once adjusted sound is good. More comfortable for the ears than the brookstone I purchased and returned.","Sound is good but it is hard to tune in and has .... Sound is good but it is hard to tune in and has almost 2 seconds lag when you watch TV.Don't buy. You can try bluetooth headphones.","Easy peasy!. Easy installation!  Works great!  Very good sound.","You get what you pay for. When I first received these I really liked them. The sound was good and the reception was great! I could walk outside my house and take the trash out in the alley and still listen to my music. Over time I noticed I was receiving more and more noise and interference... Then one day they just stopped working. I tried changing the batteries and reconnecting everything... It was dead and there was no reviving it.","Sounds quality average. Quality of sound is not very good. I guess you need to put more money if you want good sound. Bose wireless didn't exist yet when I bought this one.","The 80's called and they want their sound back.. How would I rate this? Not well. I'm not an audiophile, but I remember a my first Sony Walkman in the late 80's. Maybe it was 1988 maybe, 1989, but either way, when I put on these headphones, that what it took me back to. Not in a good way. My iPod EarPods sound better. Seriously. These are awful. Save you money.","Very good and comfortable. Very good and comfortable, wish the headset had separate volume controls for each ear, some hearing impaired people could adjust one ear over the other to balance sound since their may be an imbalance of sensitivity.","The sound quality is good enough, but I am using these with a .... The sound quality is good enough, but I am using these with a computer. If there is no sound playing for 3-5 minutes, the headphones disconnect and it blasts static through the headphones. This needs ti either be configurable of fixed.","they have good sound reproduction including good base response. I use these headphones with my electronic drums. they have good sound reproduction including good base response. they are light and comfortable. they have a little hiss when no sound is present. they are a good product for the price.","Good sound.  Comfortable fit.. Like the sound quality.  Ease of setup.","Perfect for families with a sleeping baby. Bought this to be able to watch TV in the evening after the baby goes to sleep.  Great quality and sound.  As good as having a theater quality surround sound system.  Comfortable to wear and very easy to hook up to the tv.","the sound is pretty good until the next time you use them. A little high maintenance to get the proper sound adjustment, i.e., to avoid static or sudden loud volume.  Once you get it set correctly, the sound is pretty good until the next time you use them.  All in all, however, I like them.","but sound quality is very good..

After using these for a few months now, they sound great and have been holding up very well.  I love the sound quality from these headphones as there is really no processing going on within the device.  You are going to hear the material you are listening to as it was meant to be heard.  No extra bass or sound processing.  These are the industry standard for a reason!","Four Stars. Like them very much. Wonderful sound quality and fairly priced. Not the most comfortable though.","Very Happy Except for the Price. An excellent product that makes music sound great and lets you hear things that you may have never heard before without the use of a high-quality headphone. Just drop the price by about $30 and then I'll rate it as a 5-star product.","Right Ear went Dead. I loved these headphones. Great noise cancellation, amazing quality sound, good design. Obviously the product reviews speak for themselves.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI owned them for a few years but used them only occasionally as these were a luxury buy. Few times a month for video or sound editing, couple of flights..... I hadn't used them for a long time and one day I plugged them in and the right side was dead.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese were great headphones but damn....don't think it's worth it to buy them a second time around.","Ex-Bose Customer. In my opinion, for consumer usage, the Bose QC15 sound better. The sound is rounder, but they are also three times more expensive.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe extremely flat and balanced response from the 7606 was a surprise and took a while to get used too. I can definitely see the appeal for sound engineers where flatness is king, but for a consumer its nice to have some of the kinks ironed out.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nStill, I'm never going back to Bose. The cans provide enough sound canceling, there are no batteries, and the sound quality is excellent.","Four Stars.

The only problem I have is that the coiled cord beings to uncurl and knot up in some places (after a few times on rolling in back up). The pads have started to flake a bit too.

These headphones aren't for everyday listening.  The quality was excellent, but lack of basic music control features on the wire was very frustrating (reaching into pocket to stop music or make it louder is not acceptable for users these days.

The ability to block outside noise is marginal .... I've had these for about a year. The sound quality is good. The ability to block outside noise is marginal at best. The ear cup \"faux leather\" skins have already torn, which has no effect on utility, but with the foam exposed, I'm sure they will degrade quickly from now. I have new \"knock off\" pads on order: The Sony replacements are quite expensive, particularly considering their short life.","Very Pleased with These Headphones. Bought these Sony MDR7506 headphone as a result of amazon.com customer reviews.  Was very pleased with the sound quality and the price was great.  They fully met my expectations.","Best headphones for the price. Sound is amazing on these headphones. Very clear, very analytical sound. Cannot find headphones with equal sound quality for the same price. Mine broke after a couple years, but I bought another as the other brands could not compete. Only thing is they are closed ear, and can hurt your ears if wearing glasses and wearing the headphones for long periods. But I bought these for the sound quality.","Overall thumbs up. pros:\r\r\r\n1) very comfortable\r\r\r\n2) great sound quality\r\r\r\n3) Seems very well made (but time will tell)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\ncons:\r\r\r\n1) placement of the cable (left versus right ear) is not reversible\r\r\r\n2) sound isolation isn't that great.

Durable, reliable and overall great fit for many different environments.","High Quality. Wow, great sound and great fidelity for a very reasonable price","GREAT SOUND AT A GOOD PRICE. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who is into high fidelity on a grand scale. The ear pads are comfortable and the sound quality if unbelievable. I love mine.","Low on bass. I love the clear sound quality but when I am listening to great music on my stereo then plug these in the bass almost totally disappears.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIt is very low on the bass.

It's used by the pros, it's cheaper than the popular junk, and they get the job done.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can hear things in songs, games, and voice chat that I never heard before. Excellent quality -- both build and sound production.","Best Quality and Value for the cost. Excellent sound, great build, comfy fit, lightweight - crisp highs, deep bass, smooth midrange - overall a fantastic set of cans","Sturdy, sound quality is not bad. Been using them for many years and plan to for a few more.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros: Sturdy, sound quality is not bad, cord length is a big plus.\r\r\r\nCons: When you just buy them, for a few weeks the ear pads (or whatever they are called) can feel stiff\/uncomfortable. Don't worry, they will become softer as you use them more.\r\r\r\nBigger con - the cheap material (black film) on the ear pads eventually starts to shed in small bits.","Comfortable and Good Sound Quality. I used to own a pair of Sony headphones many years ago and kept it for years. Since then I've tried so many headphones. I found Sony is still the best for me. Sound quality is good for practice and rehearsals. I can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort. Chord length is perfect -- no extension needed.","Could Be More Comfortable On The Ears. Excellent headphones but I think it may be possible to make the headphones more comfortable on the ears; They do not feel soft on the ears; They feel hard\/firm; Maybe use memory foam.  Sound quality seems fine.  I use these for music recording, listening, and for listening to binaural beats when astral projecting (having out of body experiences).","I heard these were like professional quality but i found them to be way .... I heard these were like professional quality but i found them to be way less then that. I got a 20 dollar set of Behringer headphones that sound much better. These have a tinny sound to them, as well as when listening with them, i hear what sounds like an old 33 1\/3 record scraping sound through them.  I do like the heavy duty cord but thats not worth a thing if the sound quality is jacked.","Excellent!!!. Got a pair of these for my sound booth in my home studio.  Everyone who uses them, whether for vocal recording or percussion loves these headphones!  Some musicians actually have brought their own MDR7506's to record and when they realize I already have a pair in the booth they are glad to see I know quality.  I'm glad Sony is still making these!","I feel very comfortable while wearing this headphones. I feel very comfortable while wearing this headphones.  The sounds quality is very good.  I would recommend it for home use.  I like this so much, I bought the second one for my brother.","Bad ergonomics. Audio quality is fine.  However, the cans are too shallow and after 20 minutes of use my ears really hurt.  Further, the foam material makes crinkly sounds against my ears if I move my head.  Very distracting.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOverall, these are not usable.","Good sound but not comfortable.. Got this to monitor my recordings.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nFor sound quality, it's a good buy for this price.

Always been a Sony fan but have to admit I'm very disappointed with these. Sound was decent while they lasted but left channel just quit working right in the middle of mixing down a recording. Bought a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 pros that are my go to head phones now. Sorry Sony, but you let me down.","Sony quality. These are decent headphones. When I used to listen to the headphones at the store they sounded clearer than these but overal I don't regret the purchase.","Worked very well.. Awesome sound quality.  Deep Lows and great mid tones. The Highs were very good too!  I like them enough that I would  recommend these headphones to purchase.","Another Quality SONY product. I owned a similar set of headphones since 1982 and they were always great sounding (MDR-V600). They finally broke when one of the plastic hinges went bad. After 31 years I'd say that I hope getting 1\/2 that time would be great. They certainly have the sonic quality you'd expect from this type of headphone (MDR7506).","Good quality, rich-sounding. I really like these headphones- the sound is fantastic and the build quality is very good.  I really like how they fold up into a more compact size- nice design!","Not bad. For the price you are getting good quality sound. Proper base but mids and highs can be a little too much from time to time. Honestly it a get what you pay for situation.","too tight for larger heads. it was a bit tight, could have been more flexible. as you see in the image it comes together, it wants to do that to my face too. wire was really long. wouldnt't recommend for medium-large heads for long use. sound quality was good","Great headphones at a bargain price. Great headphones at a bargain price. These are comfortable to wear for long periods, and they delivery clear, high-quality sound.","Stunning. I was simply amazed by the overall quality, sound dynamics, and the accuracy of the bass and treble response of these headphones.  I consider myself a picky audiophile and hence have very high standards when it comes to audio equipment.  Dollar for dollar these headphones are probably the best purchase I have made in over 30 years.  You can almost \"see into the music\", the sound is that clear.  And comfort is excellent as well.  I've worn these for hours with absolutely no fatigue or discomfort.  These phones richly deserve an A+ rating.","Not Recommended!. Not recommended.  Sound quality is sub standard","Highest quality headphones at a reasonable price.. For the price these are probably the best headphones I've ever had. Sony is good at providing quality headphones without charging you hundreds of dollars. They don't have the sound of a pair of Beats, but they're close and you won't freak out if you drop them because they don't cost a whole paycheck. My only problem with them is that they crush my ears and it hurts to keep them on for extended periods of time. And I don't have particularly big ears.","great value, great sound, great product. For this price you can't beat 'em.\r\r\r\nSound quality is excellent...I'm not an audiophile, and my hearing isn't good enough to pick up subtle differences between sounds quality and other more expensive headsets (was a Bose owner until I left the dang things on a plane)... These do just fine...I use them for playing guitar...listening to music...watching TV occasionally...no complaints. Well made and fold up into a nice compact form factor for travelling. There are lighter phones out there, but these feel good on the head for over an hour, in my experience.","exaggerated frequency response curve. After reading so many reviews I decided to get a set. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The mechanical design and construction are excellent. These are obviously quality headphones. I just don't care for the frequency response. I am used to the AKG K240 series which has a very smooth, flat frequency response. The highs and mid-lows on the Sonys sound very exaggerated to my ears. Maybe OK for listening to some types of music but not what I want for mixing or critical listening,","Best headphone on the market. One of the best headphones I've ever had. Truly professional, Don't even need to turn on any noise cancelling button. Once in, it blocks everything and the sound quality is just... pure. Can't even talk about the price, can't compare it to overprice you know what; and every (literally EVERY) part of that headphone is changeable if something happens to it. I highly recommend it, it's worth every dollar and a good investment.","its also not very comfortable. decent quality sound, but it keeps turning itself in all the time which makes it cumbersome to have in the ears. its also not very comfortable","but they are perfect for home listening and recording and have satisfied my .... My boyfriend bought these headphones for home recording, to use on his Nord keyboard so he doesn't wake the baby, and for listening to vinyl in bed. The sound quality is clear to the point that they pick up on way more of the scratches and dust bumps on a record than our speakers do. The tones are rich and reflect the price point - they're not $300 headphones, but they are perfect for home listening and recording and have satisfied my audiophile musician boyfriend.","Sound quality is so much better than the earbuds that I've been using. Sound quality is so much better than the earbuds that I've been using.  They are comfortable and fold in a convenient way for storage.  I use this model for both listening to digital music and electric guitar patched through an effects processor.  Sony is still a brand that I can trust.","SOLID! I love these.... These are some of my favorite headphones... They sound great and aren't bass heavy like many others are. They run a little hotter than many other headphones I have like my AKG's. Great quality at a great  price. These work better than many other headphones costing significantly more.","good sound, gives music clear definition, very pleased. Enjoying these very much.  Made me appreciate music all over again.  Would love to get this soundstage and quality on long lasting blue tooth.  All things considered very reasonably priced.  Lightweight and comfortable. Ear cups almost flat enough to sleep with ear against the pillow. Ear cups somewhat flip-floppy which leads you to wonder if they are durable enough.  But, so far these provide the best listening experience in the house.","Four Stars. Excelent sound quality, not as comfortable as Sennheiser hd 518 , and small for my ears","Great sound quality. The sound quality is great, and is exactly what I wanted to connect to my computer; did not want the additional steps of pairing and charging wireless\/Bluetooth headphones. The fit is probably a bit small for my ears but finding that I notice it less the more I use them. Like the coiled cable, which doesn't tangle with the other cables on my desktop.","Wow. I've had many sets of higher-priced ($250+)headphones over the years, but none compare to these.  The build quality, comfort, and sound quality (especially the fast bass) of these really shine.","Good- but HYPED. These headphones have fantastic build-quality and REALLY clear sound! Sadly, the highs are actually almost LOUD and the bass is just too pronounced. They'd definitely be useful for closed-back vocal monitoring, but I can't say I'd recommend these for mixing.\r\r\r\nTake a look at the Koss UR55 for that task.","Excellent headphones. Virtually identical with the MDRV6 I have used for about 15 years before the cord insulation\r\r\r\nfailed, the 7506 seems to be a bit sturdier then the V6 with equally high quality sound.\r\r\r\nArrived promptly in the usual SONY nice package.

I owned a similar set of headphones since 1982 and they were always great sounding (MDR-V600). They finally broke when one of the plastic hinges went bad. After 31 years I'd say that I hope getting 1\/2 that time would be great. They certainly have the sonic quality you'd expect from this type of headphone (MDR7506).","Great, clear. Great, clear, accurate sound.  Could be more indestructible. I worry the cable that connects the speakers in each ear will get caught on something and break.","Great as monitor.. As a drummer, these work great as monitors. They sound great for music as well.","Sony trap. I am completely baffled as to how these have been studio standard for so many years.

Its been a while since I've used the Sony MDR line of headphones, but these sound great, they don't seem as indestructible as I remember the older models being.

There are lighter phones out there, but these feel good on the head for over an hour, in my experience.","Great Price for Rich Sound. For the price you can't go wrong with these headphones, they are very good. This pair has a very nice deep rich sound. The only things I have to complain about are that the muff material could have been made out of something that wouldn't make your ears hot and sweaty at times. The band is very compressed so I had to bend it backwards carefully to reduce the tension on my head and ears.","Yes they are as good as everyone says.. Works and sounds great.

I am in charge of the AV stuff and room at church.  We needed a new headphone for the sound board.  I tested them out and they are great sounding.  My guys thank me and said they were the best they have used.  Now I have to make sure they don't walk off...","SOLID! I love these.... These are some of my favorite headphones...

These work better than many other headphones costing significantly more.","Great sound quality. The sound quality is great, and is exactly what I wanted to connect to my computer; did not want the additional steps of pairing and charging wireless\/Bluetooth headphones.

Look they are not the best headphones out there at any price like some claim, but they really do sound very, very good, and they are are bargain for what you are getting.

I am not an audiophile but I love how these headphones sound. They're sitting at my desk at work and I use them everyday. I love how you can hear every detail of the music. Way cheaper than a lot of headphones out there and it sounds really good!!!! I always recommend them to friends looking for a new pair of headphones. I think they have an incredible value for the cost. Also they are really comfortable. I can use them for several hours without any discomfort.","Glad I got this.. Price was right, very good sound, very comfortable and you don't hear a lot of excess noise.","Excellent Monitor Headphones. I bought these because of their rock solid performance. I used a pair like these while volunteering at the KPBS radio studios, and so when I needed a good pair of noise isolating, monitor headphones for my home recording studio, I did not hesitate to get them. They work as designed, the response is flat and they isolate you from the noises in the room as well as prevent the sounds from being picked-up by the microphone.","good sound for the price which is why I'm using ....

The ability to block outside noise is marginal .... I've had these for about a year. The sound quality is good. The ability to block outside noise is marginal at best. The ear cup \"faux leather\" skins have already torn, which has no effect on utility, but with the foam exposed, I'm sure they will degrade quickly from now.

Pretty long so you can move around your office (unlike iphone headphones), and they're very comfortable over your ear and the sound\/bass is amazing.  Also, no batteries needed!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe only downside is, sometimes i get a tiny static shock.  If anyone figures out how to avoid this let me know.

Since then I've tried so many headphones. I found Sony is still the best for me. Sound quality is good for practice and rehearsals. I can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort. Chord length is perfect -- no extension needed.","Very good headphones after replacing stock earpads. I use this to listen to music from my computer.  The cord is nice and long and coiled, so it doesn't get in the way but lets me move around.  The sound is good.  My only issue was that the ear cups weren't super comfortable.

The bass response is better now and I have no complaints there.","great while they lasted...10 months.. classic set of headphones, sound is superb for the price, yet the plug pulled apart after less than a year of once-a-week listening and now only one side works.","High-Quality At an Affordable Price. These are a great set of affordable high-quality over the ear headphones. Very comfortable and reliable, also come with a 3.5mm adapter. Although not a negative, I don't care too much for the cord with these headphones. It's too long and gets \"jumbled-up\" a lot of the time. Would have also been nice if the cord could be replaced\/swapped. However, these to preferences of mine don't negate the performance and quality of these headphones. A good buy!","Industry Standard. I would say every sound engineer have use this headphone before, sturdy never break. Great sound for the price. I se them for my productions good cans.","Great headphones at a bargain price. Great headphones at a bargain price. These are comfortable to wear for long periods, and they delivery clear, high-quality sound.","great value, great sound, great product. For this price you can't beat 'em.\r\r\r\nSound quality is excellent...I'm not an audiophile, and my hearing isn't good enough to pick up subtle differences between sounds quality and other more expensive headsets (was a Bose owner until I left the dang things on a plane)... These do just fine...I use them for playing guitar...listening to music...watching TV occasionally...no complaints. Well made and fold up into a nice compact form factor for travelling. There are lighter phones out there, but these feel good on the head for over an hour, in my experience.","Great Price for Rich Sound. For the price you can't go wrong with these headphones, they are very good. This pair has a very nice deep rich sound. The only things I have to complain about are that the muff material could have been made out of something that wouldn't make your ears hot and sweaty at times. The band is very compressed so I had to bend it backwards carefully to reduce the tension on my head and ears.","I love these headphones.. Great fit, light, they do not pinch ears.  I have these paired with a Magni\/Modi Amp\/Dac and they sound phenomenal.  They are inexpensive workhorse cans that I thought would be average in sound.  I was blown away by the sound and still am.  I do not need a better set of headphones as these are crisp, clear and detailed.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI love these cans.  Great price, great sound.","Four Stars. Great but a little pricey.  Keep out external noises.  Large enough heas band for a size 9 head.","Five Stars. The perfect headphones. Low impedance, great feel, amazing price.","GREAT audio quality across the board. GREAT audio quality across the board. I can hear every bit of the audio spectrum clearly.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOnly downside is they're not the most ergonomic. they can become a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for extended periods of time. Small price to pay for the excellent audio quality.","SOLID! I love these.... These are some of my favorite headphones... They sound great and aren't bass heavy like many others are. They run a little hotter than many other headphones I have like my AKG's. Great quality at a great  price. These work better than many other headphones costing significantly more.","5 STARS LOVE EM!. They Sound great for the price, I'd say they're pretty accurate and comfy"]},{"ngram":"ear pads","count":14,"ngram_comments":["This is the only headphone I will ever edit our .... This is the only headphone I will ever edit our podcast.  No headphones on the market come close to this one.  Depending on the size and shape of your head you might want to consider upgrading the ear pads and head pad but you can't beat sound.","Great headphones but cheap ear pads. Industry standard headphones. They are great both on-set and for post-production work.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThis would be 5-star but I have two complaints:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n1. The headphone pads slip off easily & you're stuck having to try and get them back into groove. Super annoying especially if you're in the middle of a shoot.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n2. I left these in the trunk of a car for a short while on a hot day and the covering on the pads started to disintegrate. Replacement pads from SONY are about $30. I've found off-brand replacement pads to be pretty disappointing.","Everything good except the pads. I paid $110 for these Sony MDR7506 headphones on February 14, 2001 from a local music store. I'm on my 5th pair of $20 ear pads and I don't wear them that much. The manufacturer has had enough time to design a material that would last longer for the pads but why should they when they can eventually make as much for them as the headphones? And good luck mounting the pads on without tearing them. Otherwise this product would get 5 stars.","Best headphones for my needs. This is my second order and I ordered this one for my little brother as a present. He also loves it. I love this classic style and imo best headphones for the price. I'd buy a few of these as back ups but I'm sure other than the earpads they are very sturdy. I could change the pads anytime if I want to so no regrets at all.","The sound quality is good. The ability to block outside noise is marginal .... I've had these for about a year. The sound quality is good. The ability to block outside noise is marginal at best. The ear cup \"faux leather\" skins have already torn, which has no effect on utility, but with the foam exposed, I'm sure they will degrade quickly from now. I have new \"knock off\" pads on order: The Sony replacements are quite expensive, particularly considering their short life.","GREAT SOUND AT A GOOD PRICE. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who is into high fidelity on a grand scale. The ear pads are comfortable and the sound quality if unbelievable. I love mine.","Sturdy, sound quality is not bad. Been using them for many years and plan to for a few more.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros: Sturdy, sound quality is not bad, cord length is a big plus.\r\r\r\nCons: When you just buy them, for a few weeks the ear pads (or whatever they are called) can feel stiff\/uncomfortable. Don't worry, they will become softer as you use them more.\r\r\r\nBigger con - the cheap material (black film) on the ear pads eventually starts to shed in small bits.","Very good headphones after replacing stock earpads. I use this to listen to music from my computer.  The cord is nice and long and coiled, so it doesn't get in the way but lets me move around.  The sound is good.  My only issue was that the ear cups weren't super comfortable.  The padding is too thin, so it pressed against my ears rather than cupping my ears.  I ended up getting a pair of Brainwavz Replacement Memory Foam Earpads for another $20 which made these headphones much more comfortable","1,2,3 you're out!. Quality gone WAY DOWN in the last 20 years.  I'm done with these headphones.  I still use the original pair I bought in 1991.  Since, then I have bought two more pair and BOTH HAVE SHORTED OUT within 4 years and ALL REPLACEMENT EAR PADS nowadyas disintegrate TWICE AS FAST as the old ones.  SHAME ON YOU SONY!","Four Stars. It is okay. The ear pads did not last, Bought a pair fron another brand, seenmuch better","I work in radio.. these are the standard .... I work in radio.. these are the standard.. second pair.. finally wore out the plug after 16 years. just decided to buy new ones.  the ear pads will wear out and flake.. you can replace with with a set of felt pads that I bought here. you can search they are not hard to find.","The earpads fall off every day. Sick of these headphones.. The earpads fall off every day. Sick of these headphones.","Fairly good mid-level head phones. Ear muffs fit mostly on the ear and just a little over the ear.  After 3 years ear pads wore out and pin is dented but still usable.  Great cord and good headband.  Other reviews go into more depth of you need.","I really like the Sony headset. I read many reviews of this headset before buying. I had been using Sennheiser headset before this one. I really like the Sony headset. Lightweight, comfortable and excellent sound. Makes listening to MP3 players, iPhones, iPads and iPods better than my Sennheiser. Sound seems cleaner and clearer through the Sony headset than any headset or earbuds I've ever used."]},{"ngram":"audio quality","count":12,"ngram_comments":["Great Cans At A Great Price!. I'll just add a simple comment to agree with the thousands of reviewers who rave about the audio quality and value that these phones deliver. So far, I love every thing about 'em. Even the way they're 'presented' in the packaging is impressive -- looks like a piece of fine jewelry in the box!","Fantastic sound. Short and simple: I love these headphones. The only problem I have is that the coiled cord beings to uncurl and knot up in some places (after a few times on rolling in back up). The pads have started to flake a bit too. Amazing sound quality nonetheless. Perfect for audio mixing and editing.","if you have sensitive ears be warned. A+ audio quality, but these made my ears really hot. i cant wear all day like i would like.","Hear it all.. I can hear!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPurchased this for audio\/video editing, voice communication, and streaming.  It's used by the pros, it's cheaper than the popular junk, and they get the job done.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can hear things in songs, games, and voice chat that I never heard before. Excellent quality -- both build and sound production.","Great quality, but treat them gently!. I've only owned these for about 3 months and the cord is starting to go bad. Some of the best audio quality I've ever experienced, though. Definitely not good headphones for using with the phone. I'd recommend these for computer or audio equipment use only.","Good Audio, but shocks your ears with static electricity. I like the audio quality, but these shock my ears anytime I move in my office.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI even have a humidifier and that doesn't help with getting shocks in my ears. I'm looking for an alternative.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey are a little too tight for me, and I would have liked more space between my ear and the materials inside the ear cup.","Bad ergonomics. Audio quality is fine.  However, the cans are too shallow and after 20 minutes of use my ears really hurt.  Further, the foam material makes crinkly sounds against my ears if I move my head.  Very distracting.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOverall, these are not usable.","Best Headphones I've ever owned!. Audio quality is great, they fit great, the cord is nice, build quality is great. No complaints. Best headphones I've ever owned. I use them mostly with my Yamaha Electronic Drum kit and they're a blast!","Stunning. I was simply amazed by the overall quality, sound dynamics, and the accuracy of the bass and treble response of these headphones.  I consider myself a picky audiophile and hence have very high standards when it comes to audio equipment.  Dollar for dollar these headphones are probably the best purchase I have made in over 30 years.  You can almost \"see into the music\", the sound is that clear.  And comfort is excellent as well.

My boyfriend bought these headphones for home recording, to use on his Nord keyboard so he doesn't wake the baby, and for listening to vinyl in bed. The sound quality is clear to the point that they pick up on way more of the scratches and dust bumps on a record than our speakers do. The tones are rich and reflect the price point - they're not $300 headphones, but they are perfect for home listening and recording and have satisfied my audiophile musician boyfriend."]},{"ngram":"high quality","count":21,"ngram_comments":["Very Happy Except for the Price. An excellent product that makes music sound great and lets you hear things that you may have never heard before without the use of a high-quality headphone.

They have a nice, long coiled cord. I just expected a better build quality from Sony. They seemed cheap. They were not as comfortable as I had hoped. I already own a pair of Sony on-ear portables with active noise cancellation. These were to be for home use. I give them high marks for sound, but the comfort and quality did not meet my expectations.","Great sound & reasonable price. Great sound and built quality, highly recommended!

Great comfort.","Comfortable. Sounds great. High quality headphone. Sounds great.  Only be better if it was cordless.  The heavy cumbersome coiled cord cannot be detached, and it is quite heavy & bothersome.  I would have preferred a detachable cord so I could replace it with shorter\/lighter cord.","High Quality.

For the price these are probably the best headphones I've ever had. Sony is good at providing quality headphones without charging you hundreds of dollars. They don't have the sound of a pair of Beats, but they're close and you won't freak out if you drop them because they don't cost a whole paycheck.

They were good while they lasted, but my next headphones will once again be Sony simply cause they have lasted me a lot longer.","related_to":"Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)","discussion_id":"B003LPTAYI","discussion_name":"Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)","user_id":"A3T0WVK4T3MWX2","discourse":"Negative","dominant_topic":18,"topic_phrase":"their headphone","topic_keywords":["be","headphone","sound","good","-PRON-","great","price","have","not","quality"],"lemmas":["almost","last","year","buy","back","june","april","headphone","fail","area","where","wire","connect","earpiece","fail","day","just","fall","be","hold","only","thin","piece","string","do","not","yank","other","side","be","fine","can","not","exactly","listen","music","ear","be","good","last","-PRON-","next","headphone","will","once","again","be","simply","have","last","lot","longer"]},{"comment_id":4119,"comment":"Cord to long headphones fall off.

Pay more for better headphones if you care at all about sound quality, learned the hard way.","Good for listening to movies on a plane.. I used these on a plane. They are comfortable.  The sound quality is pretty straightforward.  It's clear with normal highs and lows. Great for listening to movies.","Great sound quality but they pinch my ears. I have a fairly small head and these phones pinch my right ear. I tried moving them and loosening the cord and they still hurt. Sound quality is great so I will keep fiddling with them.","So near and yet so wtf were they thinking?. While the anticipated sound quality is as was anticipated\/expected for a Sennheiser, the plastic over-head strap is WAY TOO TIGHT for my average-sized head. This headphone would probably be just fine for a nine-year-old's smaller skull, but for the average adult it is fiercely uncomfortable to wear for any length of time. I am literally astonished at Sennheiser for having released this product into the world with its egregious ear-to-ear clamping headband.","They cancel most outside noise out and they offer superior sound quality. I use these for my computer everyday and could not believe how well they work for the price.  They cancel most outside noise out and they offer superior sound quality.  I would definitely buy again.","Comfortable and Good Sound Quality. This headphone comes with a mini-plug (3.5mm) at the end of the cable and a mini-jack to 1\/4\" plug adapter for use with full sized phone jacks.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nFidelity is pretty good, although not excellent, but then you're not spending $100+ for these.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nComfort is reasonable with the cups fitting around my ears and being adjustable enough to fit my off-center ears.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe primarily use these for our digital pianos for silent practice at night.","but the sound quality is very good.. A little bit clunky, but the sound quality is very good.","Four Stars. Good product! Still functional and sound quality is still good after 6 months of use.","Durable as hell. I just bought a new nicer pair of Sony headphones but this pair of Sennheiser HD 202s lasted me 4 years! Amazing quality for the price. Some of the leather wore off but this was with 4 years of heavy use. The quality of the sound never faltered. Highly recommend for beginners or people that want cheaper headphones.","Just ok.. I have been using them for a few months now. Sound quality is not too good and it's not comfortable to wear for long periods of time.","Decent quality sound but uncomfortable to wear and they fall apart easily. Decent quality sound but uncomfortable to wear and they fall apart easily.  The cups fall off the headband.  The cord is way too long and even though it comes with a cord wrap its still too long for personal use.  The headband itself is tight and the cups have too little padding for any kind of extended wear.  They are also bulky and difficult to travel with.","True High Quality Headphones!. Another great Sennheiser product! These headphones provide outstanding sound quality at a very cheap price. Don't waste your money with overpriced headphones like Beats, these are true high quality headphones that are used by DJ's and sound engineers all around the world!","Love these. The sound quality with these headphones is terrific for my needs.  I'm very pleased with the quality.  Great value for the price!","Four Stars. Good sound quality, feels kinda cheap. Good travel headphones you wouldn't mind loosing.","The sound quality is fine but they eventually hurt my head after about an .... The sound quality is fine but they eventually hurt my head after about an hour of listening. Your results may vary.","Good sound, less comfort. I purchased the Sennheiser HD202 headphones from Amazon. I am not an audiophile so I won't judge sound quality which  was fine for me. I returned the Headphones because the ear pieces are intended to fit on, rather than over the ear. After about a half hour, the discomforting pressure on my ears was all I could endure no matter the TV program content.","Nice but big. I really like them but the cord is too long and they are big.  Sound quality is pretty good and worth keeping.  But cordless is the way to go.","This is definitely competition for the beats headphones.. This is definitely competition for the beats headphones. I compared the sound quality, and I could not beleive how defined the deep bass is along with the exceptional quality. I dare you to purchase these.","Four Stars. Good quality of sound and very nice isolation. For the price, it can't be beaten.","good sound quality for the price. these sound pretty good for being so cheap. the way the cups sit on the edges of my ear irritate them and i cant wear them for extended periods however.","Good but.... Not for noise isolation.  I ended getting the bose iq for that.  This one I just use on the computer at night, etc.  It is comfortable, a bit large though, and sound quality is very good.","Sennheiser generally has good quality but I wouldn't buy these again unless it .... Decent sound quality but the ear cups are TINY.  They're too small to fit around the ears and the tension is too tight for them to fit over the ears for any length of time.  Sennheiser generally has good quality but I wouldn't buy these again unless it was for a child.","Amazed that the sound quality is on par with the .... Purchased for my daughter as a cheap set of headphones to use at school.  Amazed that the sound quality is on par with the $250 Sennheiser headphones I have at work.  WOW!","Small. I admit that I wear a large hat size, but these earphones make me feel as if I am tring to use a child's toy. The earphones are very tight and the vise-like grip causes a headache. And if that wasn't bad enough, the foam ear cups hurt. I can't even say the sound quality makes up for the discomfort.","Mediocre Sound. Quality is consistent with price; i.e., mediocre. Fit is much too tight.  I bought these for use when waiting in doctor's office, etc.  to avoid carrying my more expensive headphones around and leaving them in the car.,  But for good quality sound and fit,  this was a mistake. I have two other Sennheiser  headphones sets that are much better.","ear cups are too small. Sound quality is good, however the ear cups are too small so it hurts after wearing for 20 minutes (I have normal size ears). Also there is not much space between the speaker and the ear which causes the ear to sweat a lot (since it is closed).\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI hate to return things, but I did return this one after trying to use it for 2 days","Cheaply made - spend the extra money and buy a decent set. I'm only giving these two stars because the sound quality was decent and they were comfortable. The padding on top is nothing more than a decal and comes off after a little use. I recommend spending a little extra money and buying something that will last.","Good for a budget, bad for an audiophile. Not so impressed with the fit and the sound quality, however it was a good price","Great sound quality for the money. Great sound quality for the money, but a little small for over-the-ear headphones. Starts to hurt after a couple hours.","Amazing sound quallity on the cheap.. For the price, I cannot imagine getting better sound quality. The bass and clarity are amazing. The headphones are light an very comfortable. The cord is the weak point. I would love it if the cord would unplug from the headphones. The one provided is very long and a pain in the butt! It is also of pretty low quality and eventually fails.","i cut the long cable and now it's a perfect product. The quality is absolutely amazing, especially for the price. Doesn't feel cheap either. Super comfy too. I first thought of returning them because the cable was sooooo long (no way I'm taking this snake to the gym) but then I'm like - I ain't giving up such an awesome product because of that - so I cut it and taped it back together. Now it's perfect sound, perfect comfort and perfect length. Check out how it looks with the shortened cable in the photo. Highly recommend!","An excellent buy!. These headphones seemed tight on my head at first.  So I placed them on a lamp to stretch them a little.  Now they are extremely comfortable and the sound quality is excellent!  I would buy these again if I need a replacement.","The sound quality is good and the headphones are comfortable. The sound quality is good and the headphones are comfortable.  However the jack doesn't fit snuggly into all devices.  It easily comes loose from my laptop.","Three Stars. Good headphones and comfortable to the ear.  Good quality sound.","Nice headphones for the price. I purchased these for my iPhone5. Unfortunately they aren't compatible with the iPhone5 protective case. That doesn't take away the sound quality of these headphones by any means though. Really nice base and highs from these headphones. Will be using these with other components. Highly recommended if you don't need the small size plug that Apple requires. I'm sure that there are a lot of Apple complaints out these with the iPhone5 and their redesign.","Poor quality. I have bought two Sennheiser sets of ear phones.  One is the HD202 and the other a pricey sound canceling set.\r\r\r\nThey both have the same flaw.  The ear covers on the expensive set disintegrated after 2 years  and the same with the 202.\r\r\r\n The pricey ones just rotted away leaving black gunk over my ears. When paying a couple of hundred dollars for ear phones you expect better quality.\r\r\r\n They both had very light use indoors.\r\r\r\nI like the sound quality but have to move on to Bose.\r\r\r\nMac","Sounded great but poor build quality. These headphones sounded amazing. I think they would be great for being kept in an office or at home. I purchased them as on-the-go headphones, and the build quality just was not up to Snuff.","Love. Amazing headphones for an amazing price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI am always looking for good studio headphones with little to no boost and keep coming back to these.\r\r\r\nThey offer high quality sound, that doesn't clip or distort. The extra long cord is dourable, and is great for studio use.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they are a little bit too small to be completely 'around ear' phones for me and partially rest against my ears. Not a problem for short use of up to 3 hours, but prolonged use can result in ear aches.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n100% would recommend,  and plan on buying more.","Great headphones, excellent quality of sound. Great headphones,excellent quality of sound, excellent price","Great!. They work well, worth the deal of the day cost. Super long cord! Sound quality is good.","uncomfortable fit around ears, good sound for price. If you have medium to large ears these will not comfortably surround your ears and after a short time they get warm for some reason. Uncomfortable if you wear glasses. Sound quality\/bass very good for the price. Feather light, long cord, multiple jack adaptors and cord\r\r\r\nclip\/pouch is a plus. I rate 4 for sound and a low 3 for comfort.","Can't recommend. Wires break.. We've seen the wire break right where it enters the ear cup on three different headphones from three different users. The strain relief is simply inadequate even with careful handling, which itself is a pain on something you are constantly moving around. I would give one star except for the price and vety sound quality (no surprise, weaker on bass). Mine only work after a year thanks to a soldering repair. It's a shame: two pennies' worth of rubber strain relief would fix the problem. I have liked Sennheiser for many years and am disappointed.","Cord waaaaay too long for comfortable use.. Pros: The sound quality is good for a sub $30 set of headphones.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons: However, the cord is 10+ feet long. This makes it really uncomfortable to use at a table or in bed. In an ideal set of headphones for me, the cord would be about as long as those of ipod earbuds.","Sennheiser HD202-II headphones. My son asked for these Sennheiser headphones for PC gaming and listening to music, and he said these are terrific.  i agree with his assessment - the sound quality is great, the headphones are comfortable, and the price is amazing.  Sennheiser is known for its design and sounds quality, and these headphones allow you to experience both at a really good price.","Good quality sound. A bit heavy (weight).. Pros:\r\r\r\nCheap on price but not on quality.\r\r\r\nDeliver good sound overall.\r\r\r\nNoise-cancelling.\r\r\r\nComfortable padding.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\nThey start feeling a little heavy after wearing them for about half an hour. But maybe that's just me.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI would recommend this headphones.","Okay for the price, flimsy, broke after 2 years light use.. Very thin and flimsy cord, cord unraveled and broke off where it connects to the left earpiece after 2 years of light use at a desk at work. I think they will last even less time if you use them out and about. Okay sound quality, light, not very comfortable after about 20minutes. For only ten dollars more you can get a superior headphone (from Audio-Technica for example) that has a thicker cord and will last longer.","Best mid price range headphones. These are mid price range($20 - $35) headphones of good quality -> The name Senheiser  it self assures good sound exp.","The sound quality is great, especially for the price. The sound quality is great, especially for the price, but the cups are extremely shallow. If your ears come out from your head at all, they'll end up pressed up against hard plastic, making prolonged use extremely uncomfortable.","The cord is really long but they work great!. These headphones have the longest cord I've ever seen on headphones which can be a bit obnoxious to maintain while moving around the house. They work great tho and have great sound quality.","Amazing for the price. really good quality sound.. In this price range, they are the best I've ever tried.\r\r\r\nThey help a lot to reduce ambient noisy people at the office, they are not zero noise, but they are good for that.\r\r\r\nI hate a little bit how the shape looks, kind of nerdy, but they are for the office, so, cool.","Decent Enough. These are moderately comfortable, with acceptable sound quality. They are very much a cheap pair of headphones, but do a pretty good job for a cheap pair of headphones, if you get what I mean.","Five Stars. excellent quality and sound especially for the low cost!","It died too young :(. Well.. it was great while it lasted.\r\r\r\nFor some reason the left side has lost connectivity somewhere and now it won't play sound. I never treated it badly, it stays at my computer desk. I woke up one morning to notice it didn't work anymore. It'd a shame because these headphones were amazing while they lasted..\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI would rate it a 5 for sound quality and value, but a 4 because they broke so unexpectedly.","great headphones for price. Great headphones for the money. Issues with sound quality are really only noticeable to trained ears, and even then only really when you're paying close attention. My only gripes are slight overemphasis of sibilant words in female vocals and bit too much bass emphasis.","Listen to your preference while your pal listens to theirs. These headphones block out outside noise very effectively. I can listen to whatever I want while my husband watches the games. The sound quality is pretty good. They are a little large for my head, but they are adjustable, and I can make them work.","100% tin. the sound quality is horrible.  all tin and actually hurt my ears.  I returned them.  I got these to replace the standard iphone ear buds and either these are so bad or the basic ear buds are just that amazing.  i can't imagine the ear buds are all that amazing","Crappy Headphones. These headphones are admittedly cheap, but were purchased for my wife just for occasional use at night with her iPad.  These headphones are made of cheap plastic and are not adjustable enough to be comfortable without squeezing your head to death.  She has yet to use them and I do not blame her.  The sounds that come out of the earphones are of very low quality.  Funny, because these were highly rated on some online website.  NOT RECOMMENDED!","Great product. First thing to note, these are NOT sound suppressive, but they are cushioned enough they block a substantial amount of sound.  There are no batteries or electronic components that block outside sound, they are just really well insulated.  The long cord is a really nice feature in my opinion, and they give you are cord winder as well.  They are really comfortable ON EAR, not over, headphones.  Sound quality is fantastic.","leads to easy short in the wire. You  get what you pay for, the wire is to thin, leads to easy short in the wire, not stylish and sound quality not up to par, but that's b\/c their cheap lol, Sennheiser is excellent company for headphones just buy good ones not cheap ones","Cord is way too long and gets tangled easily. Sound quality is good. Cord is way too long and gets tangled easily.\r\r\r\nSound quality is good.\r\r\r\nThe ear pieces are a little narrow.","good sound, but.... These are what seem to be durable and have good quality sound for their price, but amazon has them listed in the over ear category, my ears are either much larger than normal, or these are smaller than normal, should be on ear headphones instead IMO.","but it was really on-the-ear and pretty uncomfortable. The sound quality was ok. Advertised as over-the-ear, but it was really on-the-ear and pretty uncomfortable. The sound quality was ok, but I couldn't wear it for very long. I returned it the next day.","Great Value. Great Value. Very good sound quality. I like the long cord.","Headphone Review. This headphone made by Sennheiser is amazing. For price and quality it really can't be beat. It has a good amount of base, which allows the full range of sound to hit you. I had purchased an older version of this product years ago, almost 7 years ago, this one replaced it :)","Not bad nor good. Much simpler than I thought, it has a cord too long - maybe I didn't read the product review properly, as I use it for my travels. Sound quality is fair to good, but it is a little bulky for my purposes. Maybe for home use it would be better...","Looks a little cheap but definitely doesn't sound it.. Looks a little cheap but definitely doesn't sound it.  With these on, I can hear just about everything from my music player (especially the bass guitar) with no EQ changes.  And this is on an iPod Classic which is not really known for sound quality.  Definitely worth the $25 I paid for them and probably one of the best budget headphones I've bought.","Great headphones, especially considering the price. Great headphones, especially considering the price.  This is my second pair in five years, only because I dropped the first pair just too many times on a hard floor and loosened something.  Probably could have been fixed, but it's easier to buy a second pair because they are so inexpensive.  I use them for my computer -- they are light and extremely comfortable.  Quality of sound and music is excellent.  There is virtually no sound leakage which makes my wife happy.","AMAZING Headphones for the price. When I first got these, I was blown away by the quality for the price. They even isolated some noise out- which is nice. The sound is clear and they're great headphones for both music and vocals. Highly recommended. The only problem I've had is that the ear-pieces can fall off when the headphones are stored in my laptop bag. They just snap right back in though.","Really nice headphones. They're comfortable and they work. Really nice headphones. They're comfortable and they work. but the sound quality isn't particularly impressive. Bass really isn't very deep but you can hear it. It's worth something.","Definitely worth the price. These headphones far surpass others at much higher prices. Comfortable and excellent sound quality. Only wish there was a volume control so one person could listen at a comfortable volume while the others can hear the stereo at higher volume.","They do cut out some of the ambient noise in the room which I like. Overall a decent purchase. Decent Sound quality for the price, but these headphones are really uncomfortable. Doesn't take long for these things to make my ears hurt. Maybe it's the size of my ears, but I've seen other people say the same thing. They do cut out some of the ambient noise in the room which I like.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOverall a decent purchase. Other than making my ears hurt after a while, I can't complain much. You get what you pay for.","great headphones for the money. great headphones, comfortable around ears and excellent sound quality.","Nice And Quiet.. Got them for using it on the train and at school when absolute silence is necessary. As long as they're on properly and your volume isn't high enough to damage your hearing, then they will leak no sound. The sound quality is also acceptable.","What a Bargain!. I have numerous sets of headphones for various uses, (don't ask it's complicated) and this is the least expensive set I have ever bought. I was actually very pleasantly surprised to find that these headphones have superior sound quality and really outstanding outside noise reduction, better than headphones costing 4 times as much. The head and ear comfort is really outstanding as well.","The sound quality of these headphones for the price is pretty incredible.. The sound quality of these headphones for the price is pretty incredible.  I do have a few problems with them though.  They really are not comfortable on my head at all.

Great sound, real comfortable (adjustable), inexpensive, not too heavy. The one drawback was the overzealous length of the cord but that's nitpicking.","Sounded great but poor build quality. These headphones sounded amazing. I think they would be great for being kept in an office or at home. I purchased them as on-the-go headphones, and the build quality just was not up to Snuff.","Great!. I have been an audio-sound-freak for many years and have and have had some of the top of the line sound equipment in both theater and portable kinds. Sound-wise and weight wise, these ear phones can't be beat. The price is right as well, although that was not my primary motivation. Overall; wonderful.","Not bad. Found a pair of these at Goodwill for 5$. They sound great and haven't broken yet.","Love. Amazing headphones for an amazing price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI am always looking for good studio headphones with little to no boost and keep coming back to these.\r\r\r\nThey offer high quality sound, that doesn't clip or distort. The extra long cord is dourable, and is great for studio use.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they are a little bit too small to be completely 'around ear' phones for me and partially rest against my ears. Not a problem for short use of up to 3 hours, but prolonged use can result in ear aches.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n100% would recommend,  and plan on buying more.","Cord length. Great sound. Only struggle is the long cord. It seems to always come unwound and get in the way.","Great cheap headphones. I bought these for the kids in the car and at home.  They sound 80-90% as good as my good studio headphones, but I don't have to worry about them getting destroyed.","Great value and good sound. I purchased these as a cheap pair of over the ear head phones for work.  They sound really nice and they block out the background noise.  Sometimes, however, i wish the cord was a little shorter but for the price I really can't come up with any other complaints.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPro:\r\r\r\n - Removable \"cups\" - if the ear part falls off you can stick it back in\r\r\r\n - Good sound\r\r\r\n - Quite nicely priced ($20)\r\r\r\n - Really long cord\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCon:\r\r\r\n - Really Long cord","Great sound, but only good for small ears..

All this time she's been pumping sound through them at top volume and they only failed last week.  $20.00 so mom can watch TV for 4 yrs...too good.  I've just ordered a replacement pair for her.","Great!. They work well, worth the deal of the day cost. Super long cord! Sound quality is good.","Sennheiser HD202-II headphones. My son asked for these Sennheiser headphones for PC gaming and listening to music, and he said these are terrific.  i agree with his assessment - the sound quality is great, the headphones are comfortable, and the price is amazing.

These sound really good and the Base is huge!","The sound quality is great, especially for the price. The sound quality is great, especially for the price, but the cups are extremely shallow. If your ears come out from your head at all, they'll end up pressed up against hard plastic, making prolonged use extremely uncomfortable.","The cord is really long but they work great!. These headphones have the longest cord I've ever seen on headphones which can be a bit obnoxious to maintain while moving around the house. They work great tho and have great sound quality.","Five Stars. Great price and fantastic sound. VERY pleased with these and would buy another.","the best for the price.. for the price it's hard to beat these headphones. Great sound and isn't noise cancelling but it's close to it at times. I'd recommend these to anyone who wants headphones under $30 that do what you need them for.","OK headphones.. I probably should have listened to others who reviewed. These headphones are uncomfortable. The sound is good, not great.","Nice sound. Sound great! The main drawback is that they are a little tight on the ears. I have to periodically move them around on my ears to stay comfortable.","Not great, but adequate. Use these for non-critical listening in the studio and they are adequate to the task. A little flat sounding with too much low mid energy (I'm sure to appeal to the masses), but they get the job done. At this price point, they are a bargain.","Four Stars. Great sound from these headphones but uncomfortable wear for long periods of time.","It died too young :(. Well.. it was great while it lasted.\r\r\r\nFor some reason the left side has lost connectivity somewhere and now it won't play sound. I never treated it badly, it stays at my computer desk. I woke up one morning to notice it didn't work anymore. It'd a shame because these headphones were amazing while they lasted..\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI would rate it a 5 for sound quality and value, but a 4 because they broke so unexpectedly.","great headphones for price. Great headphones for the money. Issues with sound quality are really only noticeable to trained ears, and even then only really when you're paying close attention. My only gripes are slight overemphasis of sibilant words in female vocals and bit too much bass emphasis.","Affordable head phones give big bass and comfortable fit.. Great bass, keeps the sound in your ears and not to surrounding people.  Comfortable fit, good grip with foam cushion.  One down side, the actual phone can slide off the headrest- but just slide it back on.  Happened a few times.  Great long cord is a bonus.  Way better than earbuds, great sound for movies and such off any portable device.  I would buy them again.","Great product. First thing to note, these are NOT sound suppressive, but they are cushioned enough they block a substantial amount of sound.  There are no batteries or electronic components that block outside sound, they are just really well insulated.  The long cord is a really nice feature in my opinion, and they give you are cord winder as well.  They are really comfortable ON EAR, not over, headphones.  Sound quality is fantastic.","Sounds great- but not comfortable for extended use. These sound awesome- as all of the different Sennheiser headphones tend to do.  But after an hour of use, the strong clamping force of the headphones hurt my ears and make my head feel like it's in a vice.  I can't recommend them.","HD 202 II Headphones by Sennheiser. Received for Christmas and use them for private listening in my HAM(amateur)Radio hobby. Works and sounds great but they are a little tight on my head but that may improve with use.  Have not tried them for stereo\/theater audio yet.","Great!. I cannibalizes these to use in my snowboarding helmet. They work great and sound great. For the $20ish I paid for them, they've held up great in deeep snow for two seasons now. Impressive!","Great sound!. These headphones have amazing bass response. They are very comfortable to use, even after extended wear. They filter outside noise pretty well, too. Long cable and comes with a cord storage wrap-around that has a clip on it.  At this price, quite a great buy!","Sound great, feel alright. These sound amazing. For the price, this is a wonderful deal however I have noticed that having them on for extended periods of time bwgins to feEl very un comfortable and hurts my ears... Could be just me (I have a large head) however I kind of doubt it. Totally worth the money.","Great Value. Great Value. Very good sound quality. I like the long cord.","Good set for the computer.. Acceptable sound, great price, not dog chew resistant...","Great entry level price headphones with high end sound. This is not my first pair of these.  No corded headphones last forever. The wires eventually break from stress fatigue (as did a $200 pair of a different brand).  These are comfortable, fit well, have great sound, and worth every penny in the $20 headphone range.","Worked as expected.. They worked well for amateur radio Field Day.  They did get a little wet around the ears in the hot & humid summer weather, but they sounded great.","Great headphones, especially considering the price. Great headphones, especially considering the price.  This is my second pair in five years, only because I dropped the first pair just too many times on a hard floor and loosened something.  Probably could have been fixed, but it's easier to buy a second pair because they are so inexpensive.  I use them for my computer -- they are light and extremely comfortable.  Quality of sound and music is excellent.  There is virtually no sound leakage which makes my wife happy.","AMAZING Headphones for the price. When I first got these, I was blown away by the quality for the price. They even isolated some noise out- which is nice. The sound is clear and they're great headphones for both music and vocals. Highly recommended. The only problem I've had is that the ear-pieces can fall off when the headphones are stored in my laptop bag. They just snap right back in though.","Sennheiser Headphones. The headphones are great! the sound that is produced from them is great! This is was I needed for along time & the price was great as well. I only complaint would be the foam ear pads, my ears touch the screen inside,its needs to be a bit thicker but other than that, their great!","Great Sound. Really for the price perfect nice design for head and ears, nice sound included bass love it the HQ you can hear all sound stereo with hi bass , nothing more to say i highly recommended thing to buy another soon","Metal heads will love these. Ridiculous cost to performance ratio. Low price..but sound killer. Cord is super long, which is great for me and the inline cord wrapper thingy is a nice touch...that gets yanked on before the plug does. Ear and head pads are plush super comfy, fit over my ears nicely. Instead of HD 202 II, Sennheiser should have named them HD EarSex II. I would recommend these to ANYONE.","great value at this price. I use these with my computer and it is a great upgrade from what I was using.  Long 3 meter cord gives me great ability to move about and the ear cushions work well to reduce external sounds. Great cost value to performance is great.","As expected with Sennheiser..... I have multiple units of Sennheiser ear buds and have not found any other brand that are better. So I was at ease when purchasing these head phones and I was right. Great sound and nice fit. They were a little snug but nothing too bad as some others have been complaining about. And my head is somewhat on the large side. Overall, I would buy these again.","Ok, but not great!!!!. I bought these as a gift for my sister and she liked them but said they do not drown out the sound of her TV! She has to lower volume on her TV in order to use them.","Great price for great sounding headphones.. One of the best sounding headphones I've ever owned! Can't buy a better sounding set for the price. Highly recommended.","great headphones for the money. great headphones, comfortable around ears and excellent sound quality.","Really nice.

That seal makes them a bit warm, but that's worth the tradeoff.\r\r\r\nSolidly built.\r\r\r\nThe foam on the ear cuffs and head band seems to be the plastic covered type that I've seen break down and crumble.\r\r\r\nHope it doesn't happen on these because I'm really enjoying them.","Going to have to get one for myself.. I got this as a Christmas present for my son so I can't vouch first hand, hence the 4 star. But my son has told me they really sound great and that I should get a set. If you can't believe your son, who can you believe?","pretty good..but cord too long. Wish they would make them foldable so you could store them better.  The fit is good\/comfort is very nice.  Blocks out outside sounds very well.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe cord is very long though..and on both sides of the headset.  I got a different pair after this with only one side with the wire and lmuch shorter in length.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSound is pretty good.  I'm not an audiofile.

I don't really have any complaints about these. They're very balanced, comfortable and hard to break. Some people say they are kind of cheaply made.

Plus, these are also very light.","Good for listening to movies on a plane.. I used these on a plane. They are comfortable.  The sound quality is pretty straightforward.

Don't listen to all the negative reviews, these headphones sound good. They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time.

The product does come with a cord wrap that helps a little with the cord length.","Very good.. Great value.  Good sound, lightweight, well constructed.","Just ok..

Good sound quality, feels kinda cheap. Good travel headphones you wouldn't mind loosing.","Good sound, less comfort. I purchased the Sennheiser HD202 headphones from Amazon. I am not an audiophile so I won't judge sound quality which  was fine for me. I returned the Headphones because the ear pieces are intended to fit on, rather than over the ear.

Ironically, I picked this because the cable was longer that other models.  However, I have found this to be too much of a good thing.  Sound is excellent.","Good sound. The wife needed a decent pair of headphones for her piano practice. These sound good and are light enough to wear for hours.","Excellent Sound for The Price. Very good earphones for the price.  Comfortable and fits my big head.  I do not like high priced earphones, they do not sound any better than these, and the kids break them all, no matter how much they cost.","Mediocre Sound.

I bought these for use when waiting in doctor's office, etc.  to avoid carrying my more expensive headphones around and leaving them in the car.,  But for good quality sound and fit,  this was a mistake. I have two other Sennheiser  headphones sets that are much better.","ear cups are too small. Sound quality is good, however the ear cups are too small so it hurts after wearing for 20 minutes (I have normal size ears). Also there is not much space between the speaker and the ear which causes the ear to sweat a lot (since it is closed).\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI hate to return things, but I did return this one after trying to use it for 2 days","Clean bass with crisp highs. Good for dub. Not much midrange but the sound stays clean with almost no distortion. sounds more like a surround system \"subwoofer, small mids and tweeters\". For the price I would pick these over other cheap headphones. Who ever said these are not comfortable must have a warped head. If you want more mids go with JVC HA-RX500. I bought a variety of headphones to test out for my 6 teenagers Christmas presents. I will now have to order more of the 202's because i know they will fight over these.","Good Bang for the Buck.

I probably should have listened to others who reviewed. These headphones are uncomfortable. The sound is good, not great.","Too uncomfortable for prolonged use.. These headphones sound good, but they feel very tight and uncomfortable.  I can never wear them too long before I switch to my Samsung stock earbuds for comfort.  The cord is very very long, and though you can wind it to make it shorter, it's still annoying to deal with if you're using it for a daily commute on the subway.  I'd only use these headphones on a plane\/travel for its noise blocking abilities. They do sound very good however, and pretty effective in noise isolation.","Decent Enough. These are moderately comfortable, with acceptable sound quality. They are very much a cheap pair of headphones, but do a pretty good job for a cheap pair of headphones, if you get what I mean.","Listen to your preference while your pal listens to theirs.

This headphone made by Sennheiser is amazing. For price and quality it really can't be beat. It has a good amount of base, which allows the full range of sound to hit you. I had purchased an older version of this product years ago, almost 7 years ago, this one replaced it :)","Not bad nor good. Much simpler than I thought, it has a cord too long - maybe I didn't read the product review properly, as I use it for my travels.

The cord is too long - first of all - it is NOT practical AT ALL.. Second of all, the sound is not as good as everyone is making it out to be. I know I might be spoiled because I also have a Bose but from all the reviews I really expected something good- these headphones however gave me nothing special- nothing more than a regular headphone I could purchase at any store for 15 bucks or so..","Great value, and amazing sound.. Wasn't paid for this.  But not sure what the negatives are about.  Almost kept me from purchasing. Have had them for a while and they sound better then most headphones I've purchased and have been very durable.  Have been using them everyday on my elliptical for months and they are still going strong despite not being a \"sport\" headphone.  Super comfortable as well. I actually like the long cord, and its easy to coil any slack.  Highly recommend.","Nice but big. I really like them but the cord is too long and they are big.

In my opinion they are comfortable for 3 to 4 hours, then I have to take them off for at least a half hour so my ears can \"breathe\" a little. I also love the adjusting mechanism being built in on the back of the actual speaker holding compartment and not in the band. This makes them much more durable. Only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is because of the ridiculously long cord which is tough to keep out of your way.","comfortable. I'll make this short used to be a sound engineer and for the price these have a great sound are very comfortable. They also seem pretty durable and have an extra long cord.

The super long cord is fantastic. My job has several pairs, older , and they work perfectly still! Great investment, great price","Amazing sound quallity on the cheap.. For the price, I cannot imagine getting better sound quality. The bass and clarity are amazing. The headphones are light an very comfortable. The cord is the weak point. I would love it if the cord would unplug from the headphones. The one provided is very long and a pain in the butt! It is also of pretty low quality and eventually fails.","Cord broke - after MANY years of heavy use - bought another. The kids have been using this set of headphones for years. Many years. Maybe 8. Maybe longer. Finally, a cord broke. So they aren't totally indestructible.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSeriously, these are a great value at $40. At $20 (today's price), assuming they bear any resemblance to the old models, they are a ridiculous value.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThey work. They are simple. The sound is good.

Amazing headphones for an amazing price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI am always looking for good studio headphones with little to no boost and keep coming back to these.\r\r\r\nThey offer high quality sound, that doesn't clip or distort. The extra long cord is dourable, and is great for studio use.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they are a little bit too small to be completely 'around ear' phones for me and partially rest against my ears.

The cord is excessively long, though. No biggie.","Great value and good sound. I purchased these as a cheap pair of over the ear head phones for work.

Pros: The sound quality is good for a sub $30 set of headphones.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons: However, the cord is 10+ feet long. This makes it really uncomfortable to use at a table or in bed. In an ideal set of headphones for me, the cord would be about as long as those of ipod earbuds.","Okay for the price, flimsy, broke after 2 years light use.. Very thin and flimsy cord, cord unraveled and broke off where it connects to the left earpiece after 2 years of light use at a desk at work. I think they will last even less time if you use them out and about. Okay sound quality, light, not very comfortable after about 20minutes. For only ten dollars more you can get a superior headphone (from Audio-Technica for example) that has a thicker cord and will last longer.","The cord is really long but they work great!.

They work great tho and have great sound quality.","nice long cord which I needed. They work okay...nice long cord which I needed.","because these headphones are absolutely fantastic. The low end you get from these is .... I wish there was a six star rating, because these headphones are absolutely fantastic.  The low end you get from these is on par with headphones that cost 5 times what these do.  Be careful with the extra long cord though","Nice for the price. Didn't expect much for less than $25, but these definitely work for what I need them for.  I certainly wouldn't use them for any serious studio\/mixing work, but when I'm just laying down some vocals, these will fit the bill for input monitoring.  My kids (with much better ears than mine) say that the mids\/high-mids are a bit over-emphasized, but again...for input monitoring while recoding vocals, it'll work.

The cord is like 9 feet long which is ridiculous. That's pretty annoying. And they aren't nearly loud enough as they should be for the price.

First thing to note, these are NOT sound suppressive, but they are cushioned enough they block a substantial amount of sound.  There are no batteries or electronic components that block outside sound, they are just really well insulated.

The cord is nice and long, which is a great plus.","great headphones for price. Great headphones for the money. Issues with sound quality are really only noticeable to trained ears, and even then only really when you're paying close attention. My only gripes are slight overemphasis of sibilant words in female vocals and bit too much bass emphasis.","but great for the price. Over the ear, but they are a little small, don't cover the whole ear.  A little uncomfortable for long use, but great for the price.","Cheap but great headset. I'm not a super-serious audiophile but I .... Cheap but great headset. I'm not a super-serious audiophile but I am picky about my headsets. This one is wonderful. I only wish it had a mic, but that's probably too much to ask for at the price.","Great sound!. These headphones have amazing bass response. They are very comfortable to use, even after extended wear. They filter outside noise pretty well, too. Long cable and comes with a cord storage wrap-around that has a clip on it.  At this price, quite a great buy!","Great headphones for the price, price is to low.. I was seriously amazed when I plugged these in for the first time. Studio quality headphones for less than 30 bucks? No way, but yes way. Comfortable and feel like an even better fit compared to my costly hfi-550.","Sound great, feel alright. These sound amazing. For the price, this is a wonderful deal however I have noticed that having them on for extended periods of time bwgins to feEl very un comfortable and hurts my ears... Could be just me (I have a large head) however I kind of doubt it. Totally worth the money.","Good set for the computer.. Acceptable sound, great price, not dog chew resistant...","Great entry level price headphones with high end sound. This is not my first pair of these.  No corded headphones last forever. The wires eventually break from stress fatigue (as did a $200 pair of a different brand).  These are comfortable, fit well, have great sound, and worth every penny in the $20 headphone range.","Great headphones, especially considering the price. Great headphones, especially considering the price.  This is my second pair in five years, only because I dropped the first pair just too many times on a hard floor and loosened something.  Probably could have been fixed, but it's easier to buy a second pair because they are so inexpensive.  I use them for my computer -- they are light and extremely comfortable.  Quality of sound and music is excellent.  There is virtually no sound leakage which makes my wife happy.","AMAZING Headphones for the price. When I first got these, I was blown away by the quality for the price. They even isolated some noise out- which is nice. The sound is clear and they're great headphones for both music and vocals. Highly recommended. The only problem I've had is that the ear-pieces can fall off when the headphones are stored in my laptop bag. They just snap right back in though.","Sennheiser Headphones. The headphones are great! the sound that is produced from them is great! This is was I needed for along time & the price was great as well. I only complaint would be the foam ear pads, my ears touch the screen inside,its needs to be a bit thicker but other than that, their great!","Four Stars. Excellent value. Good quality at a great price.","Great Sound. Really for the price perfect nice design for head and ears, nice sound included bass love it the HQ you can hear all sound stereo with hi bass , nothing more to say i highly recommended thing to buy another soon","Metal heads will love these. Ridiculous cost to performance ratio. Low price..but sound killer. Cord is super long, which is great for me and the inline cord wrapper thingy is a nice touch...that gets yanked on before the plug does. Ear and head pads are plush super comfy, fit over my ears nicely. Instead of HD 202 II, Sennheiser should have named them HD EarSex II. I would recommend these to ANYONE.","great value at this price. I use these with my computer and it is a great upgrade from what I was using.  Long 3 meter cord gives me great ability to move about and the ear cushions work well to reduce external sounds.

I've used them for both drumming and gaming and still switch them on and off between the two.","Cord to long headphones fall off. I knew the cord was going to be long when I purchased this item but didn't realize just how large the cord winder was. These headphones seemed like a good buy but I wasn't real happy with the quality. They tend to detach from the arms more easily than I would've liked.","Just ok..

Good travel headphones you wouldn't mind loosing.","Uncomfortable. I never thought I'd not like a pair of headphones, it seems so simple. It's either the oval shape of the ear piece or the clamp is simply too rigid. After about 1\/2 hr they squeeze on your ears and are simply uncomfortable. Audio quality is quite good though.","Good sound, less comfort. I purchased the Sennheiser HD202 headphones from Amazon. I am not an audiophile so I won't judge sound quality which  was fine for me. I returned the Headphones because the ear pieces are intended to fit on, rather than over the ear. After about a half hour, the discomforting pressure on my ears was all I could endure no matter the TV program content.","Nice but big. I really like them but the cord is too long and they are big.

Decent sound quality but the ear cups are TINY.  They're too small to fit around the ears and the tension is too tight for them to fit over the ears for any length of time.  Sennheiser generally has good quality but I wouldn't buy these again unless it was for a child.","Really Good Quality, Fantastic Price.. Fantastic noise cancelation and directional audio. In my opinion they are comfortable for 3 to 4 hours, then I have to take them off for at least a half hour so my ears can \"breathe\" a little. I also love the adjusting mechanism being built in on the back of the actual speaker holding compartment and not in the band. This makes them much more durable. Only reason I'm not rating it 5 stars is because of the ridiculously long cord which is tough to keep out of your way.","This is very good for people we don't NEED heavy bass.. This, as I stated above, doesn't have the best of bass features. It picks up deep bass frequencies (barely) but I need way more bass.

I have two other Sennheiser  headphones sets that are much better.","ear cups are too small. Sound quality is good, however the ear cups are too small so it hurts after wearing for 20 minutes (I have normal size ears). Also there is not much space between the speaker and the ear which causes the ear to sweat a lot (since it is closed).\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI hate to return things, but I did return this one after trying to use it for 2 days","Good for a budget, bad for an audiophile.

The extra long cord is dourable, and is great for studio use.\r\r\r\nMy only complaint is that they are a little bit too small to be completely 'around ear' phones for me and partially rest against my ears. Not a problem for short use of up to 3 hours, but prolonged use can result in ear aches.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n100% would recommend,  and plan on buying more.","Good, basic headphones from a great brand.

Pros: The sound quality is good for a sub $30 set of headphones.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons: However, the cord is 10+ feet long. This makes it really uncomfortable to use at a table or in bed. In an ideal set of headphones for me, the cord would be about as long as those of ipod earbuds.","Sennheiser HD202-II headphones. My son asked for these Sennheiser headphones for PC gaming and listening to music, and he said these are terrific.  i agree with his assessment - the sound quality is great, the headphones are comfortable, and the price is amazing.

This headphone comes with a mini-plug (3.5mm) at the end of the cable and a mini-jack to 1\/4\" plug adapter for use with full sized phone jacks.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nFidelity is pretty good, although not excellent, but then you're not spending $100+ for these.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nComfort is reasonable with the cups fitting around my ears and being adjustable enough to fit my off-center ears.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe primarily use these for our digital pianos for silent practice at night.","nice headphones. Good value for the price. The cord is long enough and ear cups really soft, but could be a bit bigger. I wish that they didn't fit with the ears.","Decent quality sound but uncomfortable to wear and they fall apart easily. Decent quality sound but uncomfortable to wear and they fall apart easily.  The cups fall off the headband.  The cord is way too long and even though it comes with a cord wrap its still too long for personal use.  The headband itself is tight and the cups have too little padding for any kind of extended wear.  They are also bulky and difficult to travel with.","Still the best for the price. The only things that would make this better would be a single-sided cable design and cloth ear-cups. This is still the best \"can\" style headset for the price. Don't hesitate.","Sounded fine, but the ear cups are rather small. Sounded fine, but the ear cups are rather small, way too small to fit over the ear.  I could stand to wear them for about 30 minutes.","good sound quality for the price. these sound pretty good for being so cheap. the way the cups sit on the edges of my ear irritate them and i cant wear them for extended periods however.","Sennheiser generally has good quality but I wouldn't buy these again unless it .... Decent sound quality but the ear cups are TINY.  They're too small to fit around the ears and the tension is too tight for them to fit over the ears for any length of time.  Sennheiser generally has good quality but I wouldn't buy these again unless it was for a child.","Small. I admit that I wear a large hat size, but these earphones make me feel as if I am tring to use a child's toy. The earphones are very tight and the vise-like grip causes a headache. And if that wasn't bad enough, the foam ear cups hurt. I can't even say the sound quality makes up for the discomfort.","get panasonic instead. Sound is decent but the earcups hurt your ears after only a short amount of time","ear cups are too small. Sound quality is good, however the ear cups are too small so it hurts after wearing for 20 minutes (I have normal size ears). Also there is not much space between the speaker and the ear which causes the ear to sweat a lot (since it is closed).\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI hate to return things, but I did return this one after trying to use it for 2 days","Not quite big enough for adult ears. Ear cups are a bit too small and the cord winder is useless. That being said they sound wonderful and are very comfortable.","Uncomfortable, Failed in one week. I use headphones on a daily basis.  The ear cups on these were too small for my ears and after a time they were painful to wear.  After I'd used them for about a week, I picked them up one day to find that I was no longer getting sound from the left side.","Great value and good sound. I purchased these as a cheap pair of over the ear head phones for work.  They sound really nice and they block out the background noise.  Sometimes, however, i wish the cord was a little shorter but for the price I really can't come up with any other complaints.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPro:\r\r\r\n - Removable \"cups\" - if the ear part falls off you can stick it back in\r\r\r\n - Good sound\r\r\r\n - Quite nicely priced ($20)\r\r\r\n - Really long cord\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCon:\r\r\r\n - Really Long cord","The sound quality is great, especially for the price. The sound quality is great, especially for the price, but the cups are extremely shallow. If your ears come out from your head at all, they'll end up pressed up against hard plastic, making prolonged use extremely uncomfortable.","earcups too small.

I've been buying cheep headphones from the corner store for a while now, and after a few weeks they always, ALWAYS stop working. Finally I decided to search for affordable quality earbuds online. These earbuds have surpassed the life of all my pervious corner store earbuds, and produces a better, crisper sound. They even take a beating and still work perfect. The cushions come off a little too easy for me, but not so easy that I wouldn't recomend thses earbuds anyone.","Cheap empty sound. Don't waste your money on these cheap sounding ear phones. They sound no better than the ear buds at a dollar store.  These are NOT like the Sony ear phones available here on Amazon a few years ago.

If you are handy with a soldering iron then it is an easy fix.  Even knowing this, I still re-purchase these.","Good, cheap earphones.. I really like these. The sound quality is good and the connector is \"L\" shaped so I don't wind up shorting them out after a week like I do with straight connectors. They come with three sizes of cushion, which makes them easy to customize.

Average at best. In all aspects including sound quality. Volume level is no good in anything louder than a quiet room.","Good but not great. The music quality of these ear buds is good, not great. Exceptional bass and good clarity, but the major flaw of these earphones is that they break often. Don't get me wrong, I'm rough with earphones, so these would break pretty often. However, there are plenty of durable earphones out there that have better sound quality than these. So if you're looking for a durable pair of earbuds, these aren't for you. I'd suggest checking out Sennheiser's earbuds","Decent in-ears.. Great bang for the buck. Sound quality is not so bad but definitely not Bose\/Senheisser quality. That's why I give it only 4 out of 5 stars. But for everyday use it's fine if you're OK with not a 100% concert sound. And come on, it's for less than ten bucks.","Nice Headsets and Great Color. Good sound, fit, color and quality. I like the way the the cables are evenly spread with adjustable cable separation. The headsets can be used in the spa as long as the ear buds are not immersed in water. The price is right.","Great Purchase. I've had these for almost 2 years now & they're amazing. The sound quality is great & they've lasted me quite a while!! I highly recommend them.","Hate the way they fit. I used to order Sony's \"Sweet Little Buds\" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement. The sound quality is really pretty good for the money. For less than $10 you really can't complain.  I really have a problem with the way these fit. They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time. Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable.","Fit very well. Sound quality is ok.. Fit very well .Sound quality is ok .","hurts my ear and sounds bad. I work in front of a computer for 10 hrs a day. Not a fan... they hurt my ear and the sound quality is terrible","Very good sound quality. This product really does what it is made for, and that is to enjoy your music with a good quality, and block off annoying and unnecessary sounds. I sometimes have a hard time hearing people calling my name while wearing these.\r\r\r\nBut beware, if you get those things wet, it might ruin them, depends on how much moister came in. I had to learn that the hard way, but that was due to my clumsiness.","Just Meh...Quality and Color. The quality of these earbuds did not meet my expectations given Sony's reputation and brand. They're really lightweight, feel cheap and tangle easily. The color was also misleading, I bought the blue thinking they were like the tiffany blue depicted, but when they arrived they were baby blue. However, you can't beat the price and they do the job (sounds alright). Will just throw these in my gym bag.","Excellent Quality. These buds have excellent sound quality, a low price tag, and look and feel great!  Sony does a great job with their earbuds.  Highly recommend these!","Good for 3 months, then the static caused by the malfunctioned left ear bud is actually painful on your ear drum. Like many of the other reviews, the sound quality of these ear buds deteriorate after a few months of use. The left ear bud went out and the static it produces is actually painful on the ear drum. I used to own Skullcandy Inkd, but they tend to do the same thing. The quest for a functioning ear bud continues.","Sound quality is great. I particularly like that the left and right .... Sound quality is great.  I particularly like that the left and right phone are different so that I can tell the difference without having to read the little letters, which is difficult for me being very nearsighted, and because I walk at night and listen using them.","Great for the price.... ... but you get what you pay for.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI've been through way too many expensive headphones... and just decided to get a few of these to leave in my bag, home, etc.  This way I can always have in-ear headphones when I need them.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe quality of sound is WAY better than I imagined for the price.  But having had them for a short time,  they are starting to malfunction.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut for the price?  So what.  LOL","sound quality awesome and stay in my ears without trouble. sound quality awesome and stay in my ears without trouble, like them so much I bout two more pair for my sons","Nice but cords are too long for active wear.... The quality of sound is fine and the additional ear bud sizes offer a good selection to fit in your ear comfortably.  My only complaint is that the cords are too long.  I use these connected to my Nano when I'm working-out and I have 4 feet of cord I'm constantly fighting with.  I'm going to have to get some wire strippers and cut a section out and rejoin.","Cute but short length. Ideal for use on desk at work, but too short for using on your desktop computer if the CPU is on the floor. Sounds does cancel noise a lil bit, enough to block out loud co-workers...we all have those...yeah. But i digress. The sound quality is mid range, but again you are not expecting Bose sound on this little thing. Gets the job done. I like!","Don't waste your money. Very poor sound quality. No bass and damping total volume. Very disappointed. I have owned and enjoyed 3 pairs of SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds, which have great sound and fit. They don't seem to be available anymore.","Good sound quality, but only lasts so long. One side started to sound weird after a while and then one side died on me completely. The sound quality was good but they last me how long I expect ear buds to last, I am guilty of pulling on the cord to unplug them from my ears though","Good sound quality. I ordered these and the JBuds to compare the two. These sound much better than the JBuds, with decent bass.","Great deal.. These headphones aren't waterproof and are very inexpensive. But they produce a very good quality sound and one was submerged in a glass of tea for a few minuets and after a few shakes and a good drying works like a charm. Good purchase.","Value for money.. I was expecting better sound quality from these. I am little disappointed with these Sony headphones. Value for what you pay, good alternative for travelers who keep loosing headphones.","Buds. This itme is fairly good quality as i have purchased quite a few different types of ear phones.  Nice sound.","Very good sound quality and snug fit.. This product comes with replaceable rubber pieces to customize the fit, which is great because many other competitive products don't fit my ear well.  Great price for very good sound.","listen to me is really good prodcut. I really love the earpuds. I been using for the past two years with no any major issue. As student i through and put my earbuds everywhere, and still working great. As sound quality goes are fine. I mean you get what you pay for if you want something with very high quality then you have to aim for something more expensive","product not as described. From the description and Sony's reputation I had expected an excellent product. I compared it with several other ear buds and there was a marked difference in the sound quality. These ear buds had a tinny sound. I ended up returning these.","Ear comfort and surround sound. What a concept.. I have gone through around thirty ear buds in the last ten years. None of them had the ear comfort of these speaker pillows. The sound quality seems like full room speakers. These sound better than Bose sound systems.","I can't believe I bought something else from Sony. I have bad luck with Sony products. I think all of my reviews state that I will never buy another Sony product.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI wanted some in-the-ear buds and these had good reviews, a low price (highly discounted), and the right color.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, the left side bud has only a small fraction of the volume of the right one. The sound quality on the right bud is good, certainly better than the 99 cent ones I'm using now. I tried with several devices and never got the left bud to work correctly.","3rd pair. I love these so much I'm on my 3rd pair. One pair I wore out, the other I keep at work and this pair I use at the gym. They stay in when I run. they're comfy and have a good sound quality. I'd definitely purchase again.","Nice Pair. I always had trouble with similar products with similar prices from Skullcandy.  They never lasted more than 2 weeks without one ear bud failing.  Since I've switched to Sony, the quality of the sound and durability has been an excellent value for the price.  I'm very happy with this product.","Hey it works!. Worked so far up until the point they accidentally got ran through the washer + dryer. They lasted about 3 months but i'm sure these would've lasted much longer than that. Sound quality was average. A decent set for the price.","Poor sound quality.. I'm not really picky about sound quality, but this product was so poor, I had to say something.  I ended up tossing these guys out.  I just couldn't bear it!  Even though these guys were incredibly cheap, I feel that they were a waste of money and time.  Sony should be ashamed!","Recommended.. Excellent Buds. I had another pair and lost them. I switched to regular earphones, and they were never the same. I finally purchased this and have been using them a couple of months. No regrets. The quality of the product, and the sound they produce, there's no comparison.","Uncomfortable. These headphones are still going strong after I've had them for about a year. They have good sound quality and fit snug in the ear to drown out background noise. The only downside is that they can become uncomfortable after wearing them for a bit, even just 15 minutes.","Good sound. I always read the negative reviews first before purchasing. Most was about going dead a few days after receiving product. So far it's been more then a week and still going strong. Sound quality is very good as those mentioned in 4 and 5 star reviews. I did get an email from vendor requesting for my satisfaction feedback. Which I feel if product was really inferior, they would only send it and hope you don't complain.","Love these, have been buying them for years. I love these headphones, and I have been buying them for years.  I bought my first set in 2007 when I bought my first i-Pod. My first set lasted three years before one of the earbuds started to crackle when I moved. I heavily abused them (shoved into my tennis bag every day before matches, shoved into my book bag after walking across campus).  They block out sound and have a great quality without being ridiculously expensive like other earbuds out there.","Mixed feelings, maybe a bad pair?. This is my second pair that I have owned. My first pair, I had lost after having for a verryyy long time with no problems. However, this one in particular, the left bud went out within a year of regular use. Other than that, they are very good ear buds with great sound quality.","Decent for the price. Sound quality is good for the price.  Good quality considering the price I paid for them.  Comfortable, stays in the ear well (3 different sizes of ear buds included).\r\r\r\nIt's been over a year now and I found these earbuds to be much more durable than the Frogz earbuds.  The Frogz earbuds last me anywhere from 1-3 months, but these Sony buds have lasted over a year.  The Frogz buds definitely have much better sound quality, but lack the durability of these Sony buds.","OK. these headphones are ok.... the highs are good the mids are ok and the bass is ok not to overpowering...  overall great sound quality.. i would recommend these for an average consumer","Good sound quality. Very cheap good sound quality.  Remember if you want something extraordinary you have to pay more than usual","Five Stars.

I get these about once every two months because they are cheap.  They only last that long for hard sweaty workouts every day.  I should probably splurge and get the more expensive sport ones, but at least if I lose these, no worries.  The sound quality is excellent, while they work.","Lasted about 5 months.. One side stopped working after about 5 months. I expected it to be longer-lasting as a Sony product, so I was pretty disappointed. You should know, though, that I used it on my bike rides to school, stuffed it into my bag pretty aggressively, etc. So maybe if you don't use it like I did, it'll last longer. ;) When it WAS working, it was amazing!! SO much better sound quality than cheaper ones I've bought.","there are better choices out there. Sound quality it's... OK, They are really light.\r\r\r\nI purchase them because I read in several places that it must be a choice for audiofiles. BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE, there are better choices out there.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAlso wiring seems to be their Aquiles Talon. My earbuds like many others have bad wiring and each side sounds different. This is really annoying I only use them once and toss them with the old ones drawer.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI also give away a pair that seems to work right so...

Don't waste your money on these cheap sounding ear phones. They sound no better than the ear buds at a dollar store.  These are NOT like the Sony ear phones available here on Amazon a few years ago.

I go through these things like water, and this type of Sony seems to hold up longer than most. I tend to end up getting shorts in the wiring or at the plug, just because of the way I use them.

Not bad, but I expected a better sound.  I had a similar pair of headphones, I bought almost 10 years ago, earbuds were a newer deal back then.  They had a phenomenal sound.  I lost one of the earbuds and figured I would get a new set, it turns out I am still using the 10 year old set with the buds from these earbuds.","Good price but should last longer then 3 months. 2-3 months life spam before one of the earbuds starts to lose sound.

An upgrade from the JVC Gumys I was loyal to for years. The jack is more protected and sturdier. Ear buds are even more comfortable. Permanently making the switch!","They Are Cheap For a Reason. They broke after <6 months use. One earpiece is silent while the other is muted. And I've tried other earbuds with the same device and it's not the jack on the device, it's the headphones.","A Great Purchase!. I think the sound through these is perfect for my needs.  The ear buds are soft and comfortable and I can listen for hours, barely noticing them in my ears.","Great Headphones. Bought them for my nephew as a gift. He loved them and explained to me that the sound was very clear. You can never go wrong with Sony.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOn the flip side, I wish Sony made their earbuds with less chance of shortage. I guess for the price I shouldn't complain, right? Lol.","Decent sound, cheap and affordable. These are much better than the skullkandy headphones you will normally encounter in a retail store. Sony makes wonderful cheap earbuds like these, which is great if you need something that will give you good sound for cheap. Now of course you won't be getting thumping bass, but if you get a decent enough seal, you will be decently surprised about the bass you can get from these little affordable headphones. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. And I will buy again if I ever need to replace one of my cheap headphones.","They're earbuds. They do the job.  I don't love them.  But, like I said, they do the job I bought them for.","Sounds great. I really liked these earbuds. Great value, it sounds great, not very durable though when they encounter a vacuum cleaner!","Solid day to day earbuds. i love the sound these deliver. I do find myself buying a new pair every 2-3 months since the wire within the cord tends to break but these are still the best bang for the buck I've found for sound vs daily use without breaking the bank.","Can't beat these ear buds for the price. For the price, it's hard to beat these ear buds. They are comfortable and I think the sound quality is pretty good, especially considering how inexpensive they are compared to Beats, Ear Candy, Bose, etc.","Great earbuds. I bought these as replacement buds for my daughter's iPod and she loved them so much she wanted a second pair.","Not Bad. I tried these headphones in lieu of the normal panasonic brand that I buy, these don't sound as good as the panasonic ear buds but their decent. The price and shipping were great. I would purchase from this merhcant again.","These earbuds are my personal favorite!!!. I prefer the Sony In-Ear headphones a lot better because I don't have to worry about them falling off my head anymore! These are so good, I bought three other earbuds in three other colors! I recommend these to everyone!!!","I have two pairs!. I love the Sony ear buds! Their small pair is perfect for my tiny ears. Lots of other ear buds give my pain after being in for a while but I can wear these for hours! (airplanes & work) This is my third pair. After loving my first pair for years I decided cleaning wasn't enough and got two new pair, one for my desk at work and a pair for my purse.","Died after just two months. These low quality cheap headphones suddenly stopped working (while listening) after about two months of light use.  Very disappointing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWhy Sony stopped making the better MDR series earbuds for about twenty to forty bucks I will never know.  They lasted a few years, not a few weeks.  :-(","Decent. Decent little ear buds. Would of been nice if they came with a built in mic as well.","sound is tinny, but good for price. sound is a bit tinny, but what would you expect from a 13$ earphones? the earphones look good and are pretty comfortable. i like that they are from a reputable brand like sony. sony has been in the industry for a long time, and knows how to make good earbuds. I enjoy listening to these as basic earbuds, but keep in mind that they do block outside noise pretty well. i found that out when i was listening to music and i couldn't hear my mom calling out to me.","Fantastic. I have many pairs of these earbuds. For the price you can't go wrong, they are sturdy and they sound great.","Great Headphones, Great price... The seller got these to me within 3 days.. and the headphones are amazing. The quality is something I'd expect from a pair of 80-100 dollar ear-buds, I have no complaints. The seller also included paperwork with all of his info for any questions or complaints, very professional all around.","Good sound, low price. I go through lots of ear buds and bought these to support my music habit. They fit my ears nicely and the sound is comparable to the $129 pair I bought before it went through the washer and dryer...","They're earbuds and they do the job.. In ear, economically priced, buds aren't expected to meet the aural quality of high dollar studio headphones.  That said, these \"do the trick\".","Terrible ear buds. These are horrible. They broke within two weeks. Every Sony ear buds or headphones I have bought break so fast it's not worth buying Sony ear buds ever again. I do not recommend any Sony head phones or ear buds. Other Sony products seem to work well but not headphones\/ear buds. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!","Wonderful sound. This ear buds are wonderful to use and have great sound. I bought another pair at an electronics store and paid more for them.","Good but not great. The music quality of these ear buds is good, not great. Exceptional bass and good clarity, but the major flaw of these earphones is that they break often. Don't get me wrong, I'm rough with earphones, so these would break pretty often. However, there are plenty of durable earphones out there that have better sound quality than these. So if you're looking for a durable pair of earbuds, these aren't for you. I'd suggest checking out Sennheiser's earbuds","Good Headphones Like the 3 different sized ear pieces. Update:  We got these on the March 15, 2014 and had to get them ready for return on April 5, 2014 because the left side earbud stopped working.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy 17 yr old is happy with these headphones and likes the fact they ship with different size ear pieces because she needed the small size.  She says they sound good and that says a lot coming from her.  The earbuds also come with a 90 day limited warranty.","They're Sony, They're Satisifactory. I like these. They're cheap and great quality for the price. They'll make music pleasing to your ears, assuming you utilize equalizer settings properly (equalizer settings are just as important if not more important than speaker\/earbud\/etc. quality). They can handle quite a lot of bass and won't shake themselves out of your ears, but your ears might not appreciate having their insides shaken up for an hour or more each day. They seem to have a better make\/quality compared to the 20 dollar Sony earbuds found in stores\/Walmart.","Nice Headsets and Great Color. Good sound, fit, color and quality. I like the way the the cables are evenly spread with adjustable cable separation. The headsets can be used in the spa as long as the ear buds are not immersed in water. The price is right.","Hate the way they fit. I used to order Sony's \"Sweet Little Buds\" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement. The sound quality is really pretty good for the money. For less than $10 you really can't complain.  I really have a problem with the way these fit. They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time. Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable.","Ear headphones. I am so amazed at the tremendous bass and sound coming from these\r\r\r\nheadphones. Great price, and finally buds that fit my ear properly. I plan\r\r\r\nto purchase two more pair before they are all out.","Not Happy. I am so disappointed with Sony right now. I received these a few weeks ago, tried them out then put them away. The sound isn't as good as my old Sony earbuds (discontinued) but their ok. The bass isn't as deep and there seem to be a bit static. I put them away for now and will use them when I really need them. Until then I am going to stick with Panasonic HJE120 earbuds, their much better at a cheaper price and have a much deeper bass. If bass isn't your thing then get these Sony earbuds.","Real Crapola. Not only is the wire so flimsy that I fear to use it outdoors, but I have tiny ear canals and they shipped with only one small fitting.  Sort of useless.  The sound from my HTC solidly built earbuds is far better and after a year, they are still like new. I bought these overpriced commodity buds because people with auditory challenges appeared to praise them in the main.","Just Meh...Quality and Color. The quality of these earbuds did not meet my expectations given Sony's reputation and brand. They're really lightweight, feel cheap and tangle easily. The color was also misleading, I bought the blue thinking they were like the tiffany blue depicted, but when they arrived they were baby blue. However, you can't beat the price and they do the job (sounds alright). Will just throw these in my gym bag.","Performs as the price would suggest.. They perform as expected. Nothing special, just ear buds.","Excellent Quality. These buds have excellent sound quality, a low price tag, and look and feel great!  Sony does a great job with their earbuds.  Highly recommend these!","Good for 3 months, then the static caused by the malfunctioned left ear bud is actually painful on your ear drum. Like many of the other reviews, the sound quality of these ear buds deteriorate after a few months of use. The left ear bud went out and the static it produces is actually painful on the ear drum. I used to own Skullcandy Inkd, but they tend to do the same thing. The quest for a functioning ear bud continues.","Good for the cost. These ear phones work well and are holding up well. My daughter uses them at home so we have not tried them when doing activity yet but the sound is good and they fit well. They came with extra buds.","Best earbuds I've found. The only thing that would make these better might be if they included an Apple style volume control\/mike on the cord.  But that would increase the price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI use these to listen in bed, and they're very good at cutting outside noise because of the neoprene tips (you get three pair of different sizes with each set of earbuds, so you can pick the right size for you.)  Unless you want to pay a lot for high -end buds, these are well worth it.","Sony Ear Buds. Love this gadget.  Stay in my ears much better and the sound is great.  Carry them with me wherever I go.  I recommend these earbuds to any and everybody who likes hands free communication or listening to your favorite music while you exercise.","Don't waste your money. Very poor sound quality. No bass and damping total volume. Very disappointed. I have owned and enjoyed 3 pairs of SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds, which have great sound and fit. They don't seem to be available anymore.","good, but buy MDR-EX37B instead. If you're trying to buy some cheap\/disposable headphones, you shouldn't buy these. These used to be my go-to pair of replacement buds for maybe 2-4 years, but now I have found that for about $5 more, you can get the MDR-EX37B (also Sony) which sound a bit better, and look WAY cooler.

They're still a great pair of cheap headphones, but if you don't buy the MDR-EX37B then you're just doing yourself a disservice.","Good sound quality, but only lasts so long. One side started to sound weird after a while and then one side died on me completely. The sound quality was good but they last me how long I expect ear buds to last, I am guilty of pulling on the cord to unplug them from my ears though","Two Stars. another if the price is cheap then it won't last ear buds.","Buds. This itme is fairly good quality as i have purchased quite a few different types of ear phones.  Nice sound.","Worked great, until they didn't.. For the price, they seemed like high quality headphones (and I'm not about to pay $40 for Apple Earbuds). But after a few months of semi-regular use, one side inexplicably stopped working. A few days later, the other one went too. Yeah they're cheap, but I expected better results than that!","Very nice pair of ear buds. Very nice pair of ear buds.  They sound great and fit great and are good to sleep with as well.. bought for my husband and he loves them.","Not my favorite. I can hear my music plus all the sounds around me\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy favorite SONY earbuds are these: Sony MDREX58V\/BLK EX Series Earbud Headphones\r\r\r\nThey keep outside noise at bay WITHOUT using sound cancelling technology.","I don't treat them the best. Normally I just shove them in my pocket .... I don't treat them the best. Normally I just shove them in my pocket or backpack. I wouldn't say I abuse my headphones, but one of the earbuds will eventually stop working after one or two months of usage. This is why I buy about 3 or 4 of these at a time. But of the price, I guess it's expected.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI'm not looking for superior quality or anything, but I was hoping they'd last a bit longer...","listen to me is really good prodcut. I really love the earpuds. I been using for the past two years with no any major issue. As student i through and put my earbuds everywhere, and still working great. As sound quality goes are fine. I mean you get what you pay for if you want something with very high quality then you have to aim for something more expensive","product not as described. From the description and Sony's reputation I had expected an excellent product. I compared it with several other ear buds and there was a marked difference in the sound quality. These ear buds had a tinny sound. I ended up returning these.","Ear comfort and surround sound. What a concept.. I have gone through around thirty ear buds in the last ten years. None of them had the ear comfort of these speaker pillows. The sound quality seems like full room speakers. These sound better than Bose sound systems.","I can't believe I bought something else from Sony. I have bad luck with Sony products. I think all of my reviews state that I will never buy another Sony product.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI wanted some in-the-ear buds and these had good reviews, a low price (highly discounted), and the right color.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, the left side bud has only a small fraction of the volume of the right one. The sound quality on the right bud is good, certainly better than the 99 cent ones I'm using now. I tried with several devices and never got the left bud to work correctly.","Recommended.. Excellent Buds. I had another pair and lost them. I switched to regular earphones, and they were never the same. I finally purchased this and have been using them a couple of months. No regrets. The quality of the product, and the sound they produce, there's no comparison.","Love these, have been buying them for years. I love these headphones, and I have been buying them for years.  I bought my first set in 2007 when I bought my first i-Pod. My first set lasted three years before one of the earbuds started to crackle when I moved. I heavily abused them (shoved into my tennis bag every day before matches, shoved into my book bag after walking across campus).  They block out sound and have a great quality without being ridiculously expensive like other earbuds out there.","good ear buds. no they aren't the best in the market but for the price they are hard to beat.. I have 2 pairs. I leave one at work and the other travels with me in my car..","Mixed feelings, maybe a bad pair?. This is my second pair that I have owned. My first pair, I had lost after having for a verryyy long time with no problems. However, this one in particular, the left bud went out within a year of regular use. Other than that, they are very good ear buds with great sound quality.","Decent for the price. Sound quality is good for the price.  Good quality considering the price I paid for them.  Comfortable, stays in the ear well (3 different sizes of ear buds included).\r\r\r\nIt's been over a year now and I found these earbuds to be much more durable than the Frogz earbuds.  The Frogz earbuds last me anywhere from 1-3 months, but these Sony buds have lasted over a year.  The Frogz buds definitely have much better sound quality, but lack the durability of these Sony buds.","nice earbuds. These are nice little earbuds.  They are reasonably priced, the sound is good, the color is great, and they are comfortable.","I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up .... I personally have always bought these because I put my phones in my pockets and sit down a lot with the jack still plugged into my phone. I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up the jack of the earbuds and the phone itself. Great quality and very good sound reproduction.","The Ears are alive, with the sound of Muuuuu-sic!. A stonking set of ear buds for cheap money.  I've bought many pairs and given them to friends with earbuds less worthy.","Five Stars. Best ear buds I've had!  Comfortable when wearing on long walks and running.","Very good but Very Short Life. I bought the previous model some time ago and it lasted for about 9 month. During that time it worked very well so I decided to buy this. The response spec looks very good for sony small earbuds. In 3 weeks, the wire at the right side earbud became loose. So I replaced it with another. But this time it even worse. After about 2 weeks of use, the right side went completely silent. I lost faith in this and returned eventually.","there are better choices out there. Sound quality it's...

Bought a second pair of these for the same price and keep them in my travel stuff for when I go out of town.

Nice headphones for the price, but Im having to crank down the treble in iTunes by ALOT when listening over half volume.","Good price but should last longer then 3 months. 2-3 months life spam before one of the earbuds starts to lose sound. I have purchased 5 of these over the years and every single one has the same problem. Good price but should last longer then 3 months. I use these for music only, while in the office.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNo Bueno.","Not bad, better options available.. Quality construction, good cord, fit my ears well, right-angle plug. These don't sound all that great though, they seem to be more of a mid-range driver, they cut off the high frequencies quite a bit.

Better than bose headsets.  It gives firm high quality sound, but it only last a year or two.  I have bought 3 sets.","color. I bought one pair an liked them so much I bought two more.

Good sound\r\r\r\nquality and comfort.","Good value. They sound good, but like all in the ear phones, they give me that \"sticking your fingers in the ears\" feelling.","Decent sound, cheap and affordable. These are much better than the skullkandy headphones you will normally encounter in a retail store. Sony makes wonderful cheap earbuds like these, which is great if you need something that will give you good sound for cheap. Now of course you won't be getting thumping bass, but if you get a decent enough seal, you will be decently surprised about the bass you can get from these little affordable headphones. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. And I will buy again if I ever need to replace one of my cheap headphones.","Go to headphones.. These headphones perform as advertised; good sound and great durability.  I wear them when working out and they have no problem working when sweaty.","Can't beat these ear buds for the price. For the price, it's hard to beat these ear buds. They are comfortable and I think the sound quality is pretty good, especially considering how inexpensive they are compared to Beats, Ear Candy, Bose, etc.","not as good as the set i had before. i had these same headphones in black before and comparatively these white ones have a stiffer cord and tinnier sound, but they're still decent.","Not Bad. I tried these headphones in lieu of the normal panasonic brand that I buy, these don't sound as good as the panasonic ear buds but their decent. The price and shipping were great. I would purchase from this merhcant again.","Use at work and are sturdy. Good sound and volume, use at work where it gets snagged sometimes and wire inside have held up just fine.","Good sound. These are a cute color although lighter than expected....not really the bright bubble gum pink as pictured. Sound quality is really good!","Comfy for small ears. Love these.  Sound is wonderful, too.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nLike how L had a braille dot on it so you can figure which ear is what in the dark.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAmazon reviews convinced me to pick these and they did good.","Great set of headphones for a good price. I like these headphones. They work well and have good sound. I have bought some other brands in the past that when I put them in my pocket will get a loose wire over time and the sound will go in and out. But not these. They are sturdy and last. Recommended.","sound is tinny, but good for price. sound is a bit tinny, but what would you expect from a 13$ earphones? the earphones look good and are pretty comfortable. i like that they are from a reputable brand like sony. sony has been in the industry for a long time, and knows how to make good earbuds. I enjoy listening to these as basic earbuds, but keep in mind that they do block outside noise pretty well. i found that out when i was listening to music and i couldn't hear my mom calling out to me.","A good choice. These Headphones are comfortable, light and have a great sound quality, mainly the bass. It's a real good choice. I do recommend that!","they don't sound good at all. they don't sound good at all.  one side sounds totally different than the other.  can't return since i bought them long ago and had them stashed until i needed them.  they're cheap, so i can't expect much.  I had another set for years and they worked well.  So i guess i just had bad luck on these.","Cheap and great!!. These headphones should be far more popular than what they are now because they are super good at noise canceling and the sound is so nice. You could mistake it for a high class super expensive one if you weren't careful.\r\r\r\nThe headphones surprisingly are very sturdy and didn't break when I accidently put them in the wash and dryer twice! Make no mistake that I didn't do it on purpose. It's really nice.","Good sound, low price. I go through lots of ear buds and bought these to support my music habit. They fit my ears nicely and the sound is comparable to the $129 pair I bought before it went through the washer and dryer...","Good sound, but no noise isolation. Bought this as replacement for headphones that came with the Samsung Galaxy player. While the sound is more clear and rich, the noise isolation is worse than with the Samsung headphones. I hear every person on the bus, and worst of all traffic noise. Great only when in a quiet environment. Gave 4 stars because the sound (when it's quiet) is definitely the best of all headphones in the price range I tried.","bad quaility. dont like the sound. too muffled and distorted. didn't pay alot for it so im not complaining. but if you want good bass don't get this.","Average at best. In all aspects including sound quality. Average at best. In all aspects including sound quality. Volume level is no good in anything louder than a quiet room.","Five Stars. Good sound. The plug has multiple reinforcement so you won't have issues with cord breakage due to strain.","Good but not great. The music quality of these ear buds is good, not great. Exceptional bass and good clarity, but the major flaw of these earphones is that they break often. Don't get me wrong, I'm rough with earphones, so these would break pretty often. However, there are plenty of durable earphones out there that have better sound quality than these. So if you're looking for a durable pair of earbuds, these aren't for you. I'd suggest checking out Sennheiser's earbuds","Good Headphones Like the 3 different sized ear pieces. Update:  We got these on the March 15, 2014 and had to get them ready for return on April 5, 2014 because the left side earbud stopped working.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy 17 yr old is happy with these headphones and likes the fact they ship with different size ear pieces because she needed the small size.  She says they sound good and that says a lot coming from her.  The earbuds also come with a 90 day limited warranty.","Good sound. Good sound for the money. L & R buds are marked plus angled inspited of what others have written.","Nice Headsets and Great Color. Good sound, fit, color and quality. I like the way the the cables are evenly spread with adjustable cable separation. The headsets can be used in the spa as long as the ear buds are not immersed in water. The price is right.","Hate the way they fit. I used to order Sony's \"Sweet Little Buds\" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement. The sound quality is really pretty good for the money. For less than $10 you really can't complain.  I really have a problem with the way these fit. They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time. Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable.","Three Stars. the hearphone look nice but it isn't as i expected it be, the sound isn't really good","Very good sound quality. This product really does what it is made for, and that is to enjoy your music with a good quality, and block off annoying and unnecessary sounds. I sometimes have a hard time hearing people calling my name while wearing these.\r\r\r\nBut beware, if you get those things wet, it might ruin them, depends on how much moister came in. I had to learn that the hard way, but that was due to my clumsiness.","Not Happy. I am so disappointed with Sony right now. I received these a few weeks ago, tried them out then put them away. The sound isn't as good as my old Sony earbuds (discontinued) but their ok. The bass isn't as deep and there seem to be a bit static. I put them away for now and will use them when I really need them. Until then I am going to stick with Panasonic HJE120 earbuds, their much better at a cheaper price and have a much deeper bass. If bass isn't your thing then get these Sony earbuds.","Good for 3 months, then the static caused by the malfunctioned left ear bud is actually painful on your ear drum. Like many of the other reviews, the sound quality of these ear buds deteriorate after a few months of use. The left ear bud went out and the static it produces is actually painful on the ear drum. I used to own Skullcandy Inkd, but they tend to do the same thing. The quest for a functioning ear bud continues.","Good for the cost. These ear phones work well and are holding up well. My daughter uses them at home so we have not tried them when doing activity yet but the sound is good and they fit well. They came with extra buds.","It's okay. Product arrived in excellent condition.  However, the sound isn't as good.  I guess you get what you paid for.  If you guys want a cheap headphone to use whenever, these are the ones for ya.","Nice but cords are too long for active wear.... The quality of sound is fine and the additional ear bud sizes offer a good selection to fit in your ear comfortably.  My only complaint is that the cords are too long.  I use these connected to my Nano when I'm working-out and I have 4 feet of cord I'm constantly fighting with.  I'm going to have to get some wire strippers and cut a section out and rejoin.","good, but buy MDR-EX37B instead. If you're trying to buy some cheap\/disposable headphones, you shouldn't buy these. These used to be my go-to pair of replacement buds for maybe 2-4 years, but now I have found that for about $5 more, you can get the MDR-EX37B (also Sony) which sound a bit better, and look WAY cooler. Check them out, buy them instead. https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=MDR-EX37B&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS655US655&oq=MDR-EX37B&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.160j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIf you're set on buying these headphones, I was never displeased with them. They're still a great pair of cheap headphones, but if you don't buy the MDR-EX37B then you're just doing yourself a disservice.","Good sound quality, but only lasts so long. One side started to sound weird after a while and then one side died on me completely. The sound quality was good but they last me how long I expect ear buds to last, I am guilty of pulling on the cord to unplug them from my ears though","Good sound quality. I ordered these and the JBuds to compare the two. These sound much better than the JBuds, with decent bass.","Good sounding very affordable headphones.. The headphones are very nice for the price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can be very hard on headphones that I wear to work; I always seem to catch the cord on something and it rips them from my ear. Eventually they quit working; imagine that. I needed a headphone that was affordable enough to not cause me anxiety when I ruined them.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese fit comfortably and have surprising sound. I would definitely buy these again.","Great deal.. These headphones aren't waterproof and are very inexpensive. But they produce a very good quality sound and one was submerged in a glass of tea for a few minuets and after a few shakes and a good drying works like a charm. Good purchase.","Value for money.. I was expecting better sound quality from these. I am little disappointed with these Sony headphones. Value for what you pay, good alternative for travelers who keep loosing headphones.","Buds. This itme is fairly good quality as i have purchased quite a few different types of ear phones.  Nice sound.","Sound is fine and the color is gorgeous. I was extremely excited when I opened the package and saw the color, its so pretty and the sound is good to. Very pleased.","Very nice pair of ear buds. Very nice pair of ear buds.  They sound great and fit great and are good to sleep with as well.. bought for my husband and he loves them.","Very good sound quality and snug fit.. This product comes with replaceable rubber pieces to customize the fit, which is great because many other competitive products don't fit my ear well.  Great price for very good sound.","listen to me is really good prodcut. I really love the earpuds. I been using for the past two years with no any major issue. As student i through and put my earbuds everywhere, and still working great. As sound quality goes are fine. I mean you get what you pay for if you want something with very high quality then you have to aim for something more expensive","Great Sounding Headphones for a Low Price. I've bought 4 pairs of these headphones sound great and have good bass. My only gripe is that the 3rd pair I got broke after a couple weeks. The wires came out of the insulation where it connects to the jack and only worked if you held them in the right spot. All my other pairs lasted me much longer though","good sound. affordable price. I'm a big fan of this product. good sound. affordable price.","I can't believe I bought something else from Sony. I have bad luck with Sony products. I think all of my reviews state that I will never buy another Sony product.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI wanted some in-the-ear buds and these had good reviews, a low price (highly discounted), and the right color.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, the left side bud has only a small fraction of the volume of the right one. The sound quality on the right bud is good, certainly better than the 99 cent ones I'm using now. I tried with several devices and never got the left bud to work correctly.","3rd pair. I love these so much I'm on my 3rd pair. One pair I wore out, the other I keep at work and this pair I use at the gym. They stay in when I run. they're comfy and have a good sound quality. I'd definitely purchase again.","Not great customer service. they work great and provide good sound.  I did have an issue with one of the small buds missing that wouldn't be a problem except that's the size i needed.  Still the medium ones seem to work OK.  I was told when I called that there wasn't a way to send just one set to replace the missing one and I didn't want the hassle of returning all of it and reordering.  So I'll make do.","Good product for the price. My son ordered these.  He said the sound was great.  He was very pleased with this product.  I guess it would help if he could keep them from going through the wash.","Uncomfortable. These headphones are still going strong after I've had them for about a year. They have good sound quality and fit snug in the ear to drown out background noise. The only downside is that they can become uncomfortable after wearing them for a bit, even just 15 minutes.","Good sound. I always read the negative reviews first before purchasing. Most was about going dead a few days after receiving product. So far it's been more then a week and still going strong. Sound quality is very good as those mentioned in 4 and 5 star reviews. I did get an email from vendor requesting for my satisfaction feedback. Which I feel if product was really inferior, they would only send it and hope you don't complain.","good headphone, useful so far. I've been using this headphone for 2 months and it's still good. However, don't expect too much about a headphone in this price, it works but it doesn't have a perfect sound effect. However, I still like it very much.","Disappointed. I usually have good experiences with sony products, but I purchased these in February of 2014 and they were broken by mid April of 2014. One ear started to sound muffled and distorted, then stopped working altogether. I regret purchasing this product.","They have good sound but.... Provide good sound, however get too much rubbing noise through the cable regardless of any activity i'm doing. Recommend other options if you are active and would rather here music than \"whoosh\" sounds when you move.","Kids like them. They seem to do a good job. Kids like them.  They seem to do a good job, and have good sound and clarity.","Like them just fine!. It's good stuff. Nice sound, not the best, but they won't fell off my ears and the wires are made out of gentle rubber, so they don't shake much when you run.","Mixed feelings, maybe a bad pair?. This is my second pair that I have owned. My first pair, I had lost after having for a verryyy long time with no problems. However, this one in particular, the left bud went out within a year of regular use. Other than that, they are very good ear buds with great sound quality.","Decent for the price. Sound quality is good for the price.  Good quality considering the price I paid for them.  Comfortable, stays in the ear well (3 different sizes of ear buds included).\r\r\r\nIt's been over a year now and I found these earbuds to be much more durable than the Frogz earbuds.  The Frogz earbuds last me anywhere from 1-3 months, but these Sony buds have lasted over a year.  The Frogz buds definitely have much better sound quality, but lack the durability of these Sony buds.","OK. these headphones are ok.... the highs are good the mids are ok and the bass is ok not to overpowering...  overall great sound quality.. i would recommend these for an average consumer","nice earbuds. These are nice little earbuds.  They are reasonably priced, the sound is good, the color is great, and they are comfortable.","Good sound quality. Very cheap good sound quality.  Remember if you want something extraordinary you have to pay more than usual","Five Stars. Sound quality is good and have had no issues with these headphones.","I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up .... I personally have always bought these because I put my phones in my pockets and sit down a lot with the jack still plugged into my phone. I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up the jack of the earbuds and the phone itself. Great quality and very good sound reproduction.","Good sound and good price, but they break too easily. These stopped working after less than one month of usage. Both ear pieces stopped working. I don't recommend them.","Great for the price.. Really nice sound and comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nbut after heavy use i began to lose sound on the left earbud. the volume was a lot lower than the right one and eventually the left side stopped working. there was no kinks or cuts on the cable i figured it just must have been the driver in the bud itself.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\ni will be getting another pair because they are really good for the price.","there are better choices out there. Sound quality it's... OK, They are really light.\r\r\r\nI purchase them because I read in several places that it must be a choice for audiofiles. BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE, there are better choices out there.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAlso wiring seems to be their Aquiles Talon. My earbuds like many others have bad wiring and each side sounds different. This is really annoying I only use them once and toss them with the old ones drawer.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI also give away a pair that seems to work right so...

Extremely lightly used, left them sitting on my desk all the time unraveled i.e. not in a pocket or wrapped around anything.

Lol.","Decent sound, cheap and affordable. These are much better than the skullkandy headphones you will normally encounter in a retail store. Sony makes wonderful cheap earbuds like these, which is great if you need something that will give you good sound for cheap. Now of course you won't be getting thumping bass, but if you get a decent enough seal, you will be decently surprised about the bass you can get from these little affordable headphones.

These headphones should be far more popular than what they are now because they are super good at noise canceling and the sound is so nice.

While the sound is more clear and rich, the noise isolation is worse than with the Samsung headphones. I hear every person on the bus, and worst of all traffic noise.

This ear buds are wonderful to use and have great sound. I bought another pair at an electronics store and paid more for them.","Good but not great. The music quality of these ear buds is good, not great. Exceptional bass and good clarity, but the major flaw of these earphones is that they break often. Don't get me wrong, I'm rough with earphones, so these would break pretty often. However, there are plenty of durable earphones out there that have better sound quality than these. So if you're looking for a durable pair of earbuds, these aren't for you. I'd suggest checking out Sennheiser's earbuds","Decent in-ears.. Great bang for the buck. Sound quality is not so bad but definitely not Bose\/Senheisser quality. That's why I give it only 4 out of 5 stars. But for everyday use it's fine if you're OK with not a 100% concert sound. And come on, it's for less than ten bucks.","Nice Headsets and Great Color. Good sound, fit, color and quality. I like the way the the cables are evenly spread with adjustable cable separation.

The cushions come off a little too easy for me, but not so easy that I wouldn't recomend thses earbuds anyone.","These are my favorite earphones.. These are my favorite earphones... stick in the ear and stay there.  I don't think I'll ever go back to another ear bud.","Love it. I've had a pair of these ear headphones before and it lasted almost a year.  I work out at least 4-5 days a week.  Very durable!","Cheap empty sound. Don't waste your money on these cheap sounding ear phones. They sound no better than the ear buds at a dollar store.  These are NOT like the Sony ear phones available here on Amazon a few years ago. If you're looking for a cheap price and poor sound quality ... then these a perfect match.","Very good earphones for the price. Very good earphones for the price. They fit my ears well, which I think is key to both comfort and good sound. For some reason the green ones are cheaper than the other colors. I'm sure there's no effect on the sound!","Great earbuds for the price. Great earbuds for the price. I go through these things like water, and this type of Sony seems to hold up longer than most. I tend to end up getting shorts in the wiring or at the plug, just because of the way I use them. Sometimes I lose the silicone earpiece. So, I stick to the cheaper end of the price spectrum, and keep spares. They just plain do the job.","Good, cheap earphones.. I really like these. The sound quality is good and the connector is \"L\" shaped so I don't wind up shorting them out after a week like I do with straight connectors. They come with three sizes of cushion, which makes them easy to customize. I wound up just making a pair specific to my ears with Sugru so I could jog with them in.","ok. I liked them. They work. Alittle ugly but thats fine as they do what they say they do. I would recommend them to anyone for a cheap ear bud","I expected more from Sony. Not bad, but I expected a better sound.  I had a similar pair of headphones, I bought almost 10 years ago, earbuds were a newer deal back then.  They had a phenomenal sound.  I lost one of the earbuds and figured I would get a new set, it turns out I am still using the 10 year old set with the buds from these earbuds.","Good Quality for the price. The quality is better than the skull candy earphones that i have of the same price segment.\r\r\r\nThe base is good and I am satisfied. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because I think there are always products which can be better that I haven't tried yet. However I would absolutely recommend this earphones for listening to music on your phone. However loud you play the quality is awesome!","One Ear Louder Than The Other. I bought 6 of these for my office colleagues. We have a very quiet office, and I decided to purchase them for folks who wanted to listen to audio thru their comp or other device. Half of them were perfect, while the other half have one ear louder than the other. I'm imagining this is the reason why they are so cheap. I don't know if I would purchase again, and I didn't even bother to send them back. Too much trouble for $7. The ones that work, work well though!","Good price but should last longer then 3 months. 2-3 months life spam before one of the earbuds starts to lose sound. I have purchased 5 of these over the years and every single one has the same problem. Good price but should last longer then 3 months. I use these for music only, while in the office.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNo Bueno.","Awesome. just saying these headphones last for ever. I had the same headphone set for a year now and its amazing. Sound is great and same for quality. I recommend this headphones. its the best out there for only 10 dollars","Extremely disappointed. I couldn't hear out of one of the earbuds just 2 days after I opened the package. Extremely disappointed","Poor quality sound. Thin treble sound with almost no bass.. Thin treble sound with almost no bass. Seinhauser headphones blow these away. Why ruin your music experience with poor sound? It is not worth it. Also, those who like to sing along will hear their own voice very loudly with buds that block the ear canals.\r\r\r\nhttp:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sennheiser-100-II-Ear-Miniheadphone-Black\/dp\/B002VPDOH8\/ref=sr_1_14?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1353771520&sr=1-14&keywords=seinhauser+headphones","Ear-headphones equal peace and quiet. I got these for my husband so he could watch videos and I could watch Netflix on my Kindle at the same time.  Everyone was happy.","Great earphones at a fantastic price. I bought these for my daughter because she lost her other 5 pair.  She said these work just as well if not better than some other kinds she was paying twice as much for.  For $10 you can't go wrong and I always order enough to get the free shipping.","Not bad, better options available.. Quality construction, good cord, fit my ears well, right-angle plug. These don't sound all that great though, they seem to be more of a mid-range driver, they cut off the high frequencies quite a bit. They sound fine for general utility but there are better options for less money. The Sony MDREX15LP sound far better, but the cord is not quite as high quality. I prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sony-MDREX15LP-Fashion-Color-EX-Series-Earbuds-White\/dp\/B00IJXCNMI\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sony MDREX15LP Fashion Color EX Series Earbuds (White)<\/a>&nbsp;to these.","They Are Cheap For a Reason. They broke after <6 months use. One earpiece is silent while the other is muted. And I've tried other earbuds with the same device and it's not the jack on the device, it's the headphones.","color. I bought one pair an liked them so much I bought two more. All are different colors so everyone have there own . Sound  quality is good & stay in your ears .","Great Headphones. Bought them for my nephew as a gift. He loved them and explained to me that the sound was very clear. You can never go wrong with Sony.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOn the flip side, I wish Sony made their earbuds with less chance of shortage. I guess for the price I shouldn't complain, right? Lol.","Good value. They sound good, but like all in the ear phones, they give me that \"sticking your fingers in the ears\" feelling.","Decent sound, cheap and affordable. These are much better than the skullkandy headphones you will normally encounter in a retail store. Sony makes wonderful cheap earbuds like these, which is great if you need something that will give you good sound for cheap. Now of course you won't be getting thumping bass, but if you get a decent enough seal, you will be decently surprised about the bass you can get from these little affordable headphones. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. And I will buy again if I ever need to replace one of my cheap headphones.","Go to headphones.. These headphones perform as advertised; good sound and great durability.  I wear them when working out and they have no problem working when sweaty.","didnt work. i had a pair previously that lasted quite a while, I just ordered a new pair,  this pair was not good, just a few days after I started using it the right ear bud just stopped working. I am going to go back to headphones.","Lasted 3 years, broke them (Camping and stuck on .... Lasted 3 years, broke them (Camping and stuck on tree, pulled hard, frayed wire, and I mean REALLY HARD, since I was walking and I didn't know)\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese went through the wash 5 times before one of the buttons stopped responding.","Not Bad. I tried these headphones in lieu of the normal panasonic brand that I buy, these don't sound as good as the panasonic ear buds but their decent. The price and shipping were great. I would purchase from this merhcant again.","These earbuds are my personal favorite!!!. I prefer the Sony In-Ear headphones a lot better because I don't have to worry about them falling off my head anymore! These are so good, I bought three other earbuds in three other colors! I recommend these to everyone!!!","I have two pairs!. I love the Sony ear buds! Their small pair is perfect for my tiny ears. Lots of other ear buds give my pain after being in for a while but I can wear these for hours! (airplanes & work) This is my third pair. After loving my first pair for years I decided cleaning wasn't enough and got two new pair, one for my desk at work and a pair for my purse.","Sony MDREX10LP\/BLK In-Ear Headphones. WOW. Exactly what I've been looking for. It is an exact fit for my ears. I'm no sound expert, but the music is perfect. I use this at the gym and they haven't fallen out once during hard cardio sessions.","Great active life headphones. Well worth the price for this product.  Perfect for in the gym, I've also used them while riding in military aircraft (under a pair of peltors) and walking around campus.  They last about a year or two with proper care (the cords are thin and can be pulled from the ear bud if not properly cared for) before you decide to get a new pair.","Died after just two months. These low quality cheap headphones suddenly stopped working (while listening) after about two months of light use.  Very disappointing.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWhy Sony stopped making the better MDR series earbuds for about twenty to forty bucks I will never know.  They lasted a few years, not a few weeks.  :-(","Four Stars. Comfortable and decent sound from this pair of ear phones.","Work Well for Me. These in-ear headphones are colorful and are very clear sounding. I like them very much. I have several pairs of them.","sound is tinny, but good for price. sound is a bit tinny, but what would you expect from a 13$ earphones? the earphones look good and are pretty comfortable. i like that they are from a reputable brand like sony. sony has been in the industry for a long time, and knows how to make good earbuds. I enjoy listening to these as basic earbuds, but keep in mind that they do block outside noise pretty well. i found that out when i was listening to music and i couldn't hear my mom calling out to me.","they don't sound good at all. they don't sound good at all.  one side sounds totally different than the other.  can't return since i bought them long ago and had them stashed until i needed them.  they're cheap, so i can't expect much.  I had another set for years and they worked well.  So i guess i just had bad luck on these.","ear phones. This was given as a gift to my child and she\/he loved the sound that it produces.  Also likes how they fit the ear.","I love these headphones. I love these headphones, I keep buying them. Problem is they don't seem to last very long. One ear always ends up dying on me. I love the fit so much I keep coming back.","But I don't like this type of earphones. But I don't like this type of earphones, I'd much rather get the ones that sit outside your ear canal or even those lame hipsterish huge deals everybody wears nowadays.","Great Headphones, Great price... The seller got these to me within 3 days.. and the headphones are amazing. The quality is something I'd expect from a pair of 80-100 dollar ear-buds, I have no complaints. The seller also included paperwork with all of his info for any questions or complaints, very professional all around.","Good sound, but no noise isolation. Bought this as replacement for headphones that came with the Samsung Galaxy player. While the sound is more clear and rich, the noise isolation is worse than with the Samsung headphones. I hear every person on the bus, and worst of all traffic noise. Great only when in a quiet environment. Gave 4 stars because the sound (when it's quiet) is definitely the best of all headphones in the price range I tried.","They're earbuds and they do the job.. In ear, economically priced, buds aren't expected to meet the aural quality of high dollar studio headphones.  That said, these \"do the trick\".","Terrible ear buds. These are horrible. They broke within two weeks. Every Sony ear buds or headphones I have bought break so fast it's not worth buying Sony ear buds ever again. I do not recommend any Sony head phones or ear buds. Other Sony products seem to work well but not headphones\/ear buds. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!!!!","Two Stars. ok sound, but after 2 months, one ear stopped working, will try the panasonic ones next.","Good but not great. The music quality of these ear buds is good, not great. Exceptional bass and good clarity, but the major flaw of these earphones is that they break often. Don't get me wrong, I'm rough with earphones, so these would break pretty often. However, there are plenty of durable earphones out there that have better sound quality than these. So if you're looking for a durable pair of earbuds, these aren't for you. I'd suggest checking out Sennheiser's earbuds","Four Stars. Nice headphones. Mids and highs are a bit lacking, but the bass isn't overwhelming like some earphones.","Good Headphones Like the 3 different sized ear pieces. Update:  We got these on the March 15, 2014 and had to get them ready for return on April 5, 2014 because the left side earbud stopped working.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy 17 yr old is happy with these headphones and likes the fact they ship with different size ear pieces because she needed the small size.  She says they sound good and that says a lot coming from her.  The earbuds also come with a 90 day limited warranty.","These are great basic headphones. Served their purpose as a gym headphone. They were extremely cheap near Christmas. I would recommend to any non audiophile looking for some basic-inexpensive headphones.","Hate the way they fit. I used to order Sony's \"Sweet Little Buds\" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement. The sound quality is really pretty good for the money. For less than $10 you really can't complain.  I really have a problem with the way these fit. They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time. Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable.","Three Stars. the hearphone look nice but it isn't as i expected it be, the sound isn't really good","Ear headphones. I am so amazed at the tremendous bass and sound coming from these\r\r\r\nheadphones. Great price, and finally buds that fit my ear properly. I plan\r\r\r\nto purchase two more pair before they are all out.","Nice!. great value!  .  . I would recommend to anyone who wants to hear there music and there music only. . .  clear highs and lows","Love them but they break easily. I love these headphones, however if they get pulled out of your ears too many times (for example, if you run with them), they get damaged. I cannot blame the headphones for breaking when they get abused but they could have designed them to last longer. I am not an audiophile, but as a general user I love the sound they provide. I keep buying them over and over again, for the price I don't mind that too much.","Real Crapola. Not only is the wire so flimsy that I fear to use it outdoors, but I have tiny ear canals and they shipped with only one small fitting.  Sort of useless.  The sound from my HTC solidly built earbuds is far better and after a year, they are still like new. I bought these overpriced commodity buds because people with auditory challenges appeared to praise them in the main.","love them - get these. They are the best set of in-ear headphones i own.  I am totally deaf to the outside world when these are in.  Over a  year later they are still sounding amazing.  I will definitely re-order if these become defective.","Good for 3 months, then the static caused by the malfunctioned left ear bud is actually painful on your ear drum. Like many of the other reviews, the sound quality of these ear buds deteriorate after a few months of use. The left ear bud went out and the static it produces is actually painful on the ear drum. I used to own Skullcandy Inkd, but they tend to do the same thing. The quest for a functioning ear bud continues.","Good for the cost. These ear phones work well and are holding up well. My daughter uses them at home so we have not tried them when doing activity yet but the sound is good and they fit well. They came with extra buds.","Sound quality is great. I particularly like that the left and right .... Sound quality is great.  I particularly like that the left and right phone are different so that I can tell the difference without having to read the little letters, which is difficult for me being very nearsighted, and because I walk at night and listen using them.","Great for the price.... ... but you get what you pay for.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI've been through way too many expensive headphones... and just decided to get a few of these to leave in my bag, home, etc.  This way I can always have in-ear headphones when I need them.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe quality of sound is WAY better than I imagined for the price.  But having had them for a short time,  they are starting to malfunction.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBut for the price?  So what.  LOL","Failed After 3 Months. After only 3 months, my left earphone starting going in and out, then out altogether. A week after that the right side was out as well. Poorly made; I think it's breaking near where you plug it in but can't be certain. Won't buy again.","Comfortable to Wear.... Decent In ear headphone. Bass is weak but all the other sounds are very clear.\r\r\r\nVery comfortable to wear for long time.","Don't waste your money. Very poor sound quality. No bass and damping total volume. Very disappointed. I have owned and enjoyed 3 pairs of SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds, which have great sound and fit. They don't seem to be available anymore.","good, but buy MDR-EX37B instead. If you're trying to buy some cheap\/disposable headphones, you shouldn't buy these. These used to be my go-to pair of replacement buds for maybe 2-4 years, but now I have found that for about $5 more, you can get the MDR-EX37B (also Sony) which sound a bit better, and look WAY cooler. Check them out, buy them instead. https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=MDR-EX37B&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS655US655&oq=MDR-EX37B&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.160j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIf you're set on buying these headphones, I was never displeased with them. They're still a great pair of cheap headphones, but if you don't buy the MDR-EX37B then you're just doing yourself a disservice.","Good sound quality, but only lasts so long. One side started to sound weird after a while and then one side died on me completely. The sound quality was good but they last me how long I expect ear buds to last, I am guilty of pulling on the cord to unplug them from my ears though","Good sounding very affordable headphones.. The headphones are very nice for the price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can be very hard on headphones that I wear to work; I always seem to catch the cord on something and it rips them from my ear. Eventually they quit working; imagine that. I needed a headphone that was affordable enough to not cause me anxiety when I ruined them.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese fit comfortably and have surprising sound. I would definitely buy these again.","Buds. This itme is fairly good quality as i have purchased quite a few different types of ear phones.  Nice sound.","Its good quality. Well if you are thinking about high class super bass then go ahead by $150. because this is less than $10.\r\r\r\nIts very good for the people like me who don't use regularly and only for travelling and some occasionally. I don't have any complain for this headphone and if this last 1 year and money is worth what you are paying.","Worked great, until they didn't.. For the price, they seemed like high quality headphones (and I'm not about to pay $40 for Apple Earbuds). But after a few months of semi-regular use, one side inexplicably stopped working. A few days later, the other one went too. Yeah they're cheap, but I expected better results than that!","A great buy. These earphones are awesome.  I never knew such small speakers could sound so great.","Only have one Ear? These are for you!. JUNK...bought this set and one ear bud quit working, made mistake in buying another 2 sets and both of those had one ear bud QUIT working. NOTHING but JUNK!!","2 years and going. I got these in 2013 I think. Writing this in 2015. Just yesterday I was cleaning them and I messed up and the left side stopped working. So I went like s***, 2 years, gota order new ones. So I ordered some other brand and just this morning discovered they're still working fine.\r\r\r\nNo question there about durability.\r\r\r\nSometimes I forget they are on because they fit so nicely.\r\r\r\nBass is good, just the right amount. The highs get kinda tweazy on highest volumes. Mids are great.","One of the ears pieces fails and you can only hear out of one ear phone.. Extremely disappointed.  I purchased three of these.  Every single set I purchases degraded from stereo to mono after a few weeks. Happened every single time. One of the ears pieces fails and you can only hear out of one ear phone.","Not my favorite. I can hear my music plus all the sounds around me\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMy favorite SONY earbuds are these: Sony MDREX58V\/BLK EX Series Earbud Headphones\r\r\r\nThey keep outside noise at bay WITHOUT using sound cancelling technology.","Sony Ear Headphones. I love Sony products. These head phones are crisp and clear.","I don't treat them the best. Normally I just shove them in my pocket .... I don't treat them the best. Normally I just shove them in my pocket or backpack. I wouldn't say I abuse my headphones, but one of the earbuds will eventually stop working after one or two months of usage. This is why I buy about 3 or 4 of these at a time. But of the price, I guess it's expected.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI'm not looking for superior quality or anything, but I was hoping they'd last a bit longer...","color problem. It is very good ear headphone but in the image it have another color. it is dark pink, like dirty color.  I was excepted peach color in hear head phone but it is darker.","My go to headphones. These ones are my favorite I have bought them in several colors and keep them as back ups for running, The quality is great and price is better! I don't have huge expectations for headphones, that run on the cheaper side, but these were perfect I cant hear any thing else other than what i want to when im running in these.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWill and have continue to buy these!","It's okay, its decent.. I thought it would provide more bass. My headphones did not come with various ear bud sizes or options. But you can't complain for its price. I would much rather have and have had these headphones:\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPanasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/B003EM8008\/dp\/B003EM8008\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">B003EM8008<\/a>\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSlightly cheaper and much better, and comes with various ear bud sizes or options.","Ear comfort and surround sound. What a concept.. I have gone through around thirty ear buds in the last ten years. None of them had the ear comfort of these speaker pillows. The sound quality seems like full room speakers. These sound better than Bose sound systems.","I can't believe I bought something else from Sony. I have bad luck with Sony products. I think all of my reviews state that I will never buy another Sony product.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI wanted some in-the-ear buds and these had good reviews, a low price (highly discounted), and the right color.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, the left side bud has only a small fraction of the volume of the right one. The sound quality on the right bud is good, certainly better than the 99 cent ones I'm using now. I tried with several devices and never got the left bud to work correctly.","Nice Pair. I always had trouble with similar products with similar prices from Skullcandy.  They never lasted more than 2 weeks without one ear bud failing.  Since I've switched to Sony, the quality of the sound and durability has been an excellent value for the price.  I'm very happy with this product.","Excellent inexpensive use and abuse headphones.. Excellent inexpensive use and abuse headphones.\r\r\r\nPros:\r\r\r\nThey have really crisp and clear sound.\r\r\r\nThey fit comfortably in my ears no discomfort even wearing them while sleeping.\r\r\r\nInexpensive, use them, abuse them, buy a new pair.\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\nSlightly flimsy, they will not last forever, but at that price you can hardly expect that.","Poor sound quality.. I'm not really picky about sound quality, but this product was so poor, I had to say something.  I ended up tossing these guys out.  I just couldn't bear it!  Even though these guys were incredibly cheap, I feel that they were a waste of money and time.  Sony should be ashamed!","Recommended.. Excellent Buds. I had another pair and lost them. I switched to regular earphones, and they were never the same. I finally purchased this and have been using them a couple of months. No regrets. The quality of the product, and the sound they produce, there's no comparison.","Uncomfortable. These headphones are still going strong after I've had them for about a year. They have good sound quality and fit snug in the ear to drown out background noise. The only downside is that they can become uncomfortable after wearing them for a bit, even just 15 minutes.","alright. worked for sometime but after 6  months I can hear the crackling in the phones in my ears no bueno sony, not impressed","Great value. Considering their price, these earphones are a great value. No, they don't sound as well as my Sennheisers, which cost me more than ten times. They fit nicely in my ears but I don't like the unequal length of the left\/right ear cables. I find this design to be a nuisance.","Disappointed. I usually have good experiences with sony products, but I purchased these in February of 2014 and they were broken by mid April of 2014. One ear started to sound muffled and distorted, then stopped working altogether. I regret purchasing this product.","Headphones. The color is beautiful, and the earphones were a gift. They were a big hit, and were loved, when given.","Love these, have been buying them for years. I love these headphones, and I have been buying them for years.  I bought my first set in 2007 when I bought my first i-Pod. My first set lasted three years before one of the earbuds started to crackle when I moved. I heavily abused them (shoved into my tennis bag every day before matches, shoved into my book bag after walking across campus).  They block out sound and have a great quality without being ridiculously expensive like other earbuds out there.","good ear buds. no they aren't the best in the market but for the price they are hard to beat.. I have 2 pairs. I leave one at work and the other travels with me in my car..","Mixed feelings, maybe a bad pair?. This is my second pair that I have owned. My first pair, I had lost after having for a verryyy long time with no problems. However, this one in particular, the left bud went out within a year of regular use. Other than that, they are very good ear buds with great sound quality.","less than a year. I have bought two of these in the last year. On both sets, the right earphone slowly dies until it is completely dead. Not the old Sony I used to know.","Pretty durable for cheap headphones.. Super cheap, and they're still going more than a year of exercising 5 days a week.","Lightweight and does not get tangled like the other costly brands out there. I am a fan of these small symphonic ear phones.  Lightweight and does not get tangled like the other costly brands out there.  The sound is sufficient for my listening pleasure.","Good product for the price.. These are nice and comfortable headphones.\r\r\r\nHowever, the cheap quality is a synonym of poor durabilty, in fact I had to throw them away after less than a year of use.","If you're sick of cheap headphones, these are a little bit better. If you don't want to spend $250 on headphones that fit in your ear and are sick of buying the cheap imitation knockoffs that cost $0.01 with $.99 shipping charges, you might be satisfied with these product. They kind of hurt my ear at first but then I realized I hadn't put on the little clear\/white ear fitting covers on. Once I put those on they didn't hurt my ear as much and it was easier to hear the music.","I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up .... I personally have always bought these because I put my phones in my pockets and sit down a lot with the jack still plugged into my phone. I love the \"L\" shape design so it doesn't mess up the jack of the earbuds and the phone itself. Great quality and very good sound reproduction.","The Ears are alive, with the sound of Muuuuu-sic!. A stonking set of ear buds for cheap money.  I've bought many pairs and given them to friends with earbuds less worthy.","Good sound and good price, but they break too easily. These stopped working after less than one month of usage. Both ear pieces stopped working. I don't recommend them.","Disappointed: shortly after using it. Disappointed:  shortly after using it, the sound in one ear quit...","Great for the price.. Really nice sound and comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nbut after heavy use i began to lose sound on the left earbud. the volume was a lot lower than the right one and eventually the left side stopped working. there was no kinks or cuts on the cable i figured it just must have been the driver in the bud itself.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\ni will be getting another pair because they are really good for the price.","there are better choices out there. Sound quality it's... OK, They are really light.\r\r\r\nI purchase them because I read in several places that it must be a choice for audiofiles. BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE, there are better choices out there.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAlso wiring seems to be their Aquiles Talon. My earbuds like many others have bad wiring and each side sounds different. This is really annoying I only use them once and toss them with the old ones drawer.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI also give away a pair that seems to work right so... Good luck finding the good quality pair in your purchase.","Nice deep green color. I already have the blue and red ones and ordered these in case I lose a pair of the others.  I like the deep green color.  I have some hearing loss in the right ear and found out that the Sonys are better for me than the other pairs I have.","These are great. Ok, I know these aren't the most expensive headphones, but for $8 I got a pair for my office at work and they are great.  Bought a second pair of these for the same price and keep them in my travel stuff for when I go out of town.  I did have a pair of these about 2 years ago, and although they only lasted for a year before one of the buds stopped working, it was well worth the $8 they cost me at the time~!","Comfortable, but one side dead after 2 months!. I bought these in December and I've already had to retire them because the left ear bud has stopped working entirely. I wish the company would replace them; it seems like there should be some sort of warranty for such a short period of time."]},{"ngram":"five stars","count":11,"ngram_comments":["Five Stars. sound is great and they are a good brand","Five Stars.

My old earbuds died, or I lost them, or something I can't remember...but I needed a new pair and these were cute so I got them. I use them all the time at work. I like that you can change out the size of the ends to fit your ear holes perfectly. They mostly sit on my desk and get popped in and out several hundred times a day... and they're been great so far!","Great sound for cheap earbuds. Great sound for cheap earbuds. They lasted me about 2 years the first time (daily abuse at the gym eventually snapped one of the wires), just ordered a new pair. Comfortable fit, good color selection.","Awesome for the money. I've been buying Sony earbuds for years because they have always had the best sound and the best fit for the money and these don't disappoint. If you are looking for big sound this isn't for you, but if your want really good sound for a low price then buy these.","good for good price. not high end, not low end.  good for what they were purchased for which is to listen to streaming sporting events.  do not need high quality music sound, just need good clear play by play.  this fits the bill without spending the money for a pricey \"i must hear each note clearly\" item.","Buds are not a good fit for this earphones. Good sound. The buds are just too weak. They come off easily and are difficult to put in.","Very good earphones for the price. Very good earphones for the price. They fit my ears well, which I think is key to both comfort and good sound. For some reason the green ones are cheaper than the other colors. I'm sure there's no effect on the sound!","Five Stars. Work great and fit the ear better than others we have tried.","Not bad, better options available.. Quality construction, good cord, fit my ears well, right-angle plug. These don't sound all that great though, they seem to be more of a mid-range driver, they cut off the high frequencies quite a bit. They sound fine for general utility but there are better options for less money. The Sony MDREX15LP sound far better, but the cord is not quite as high quality.

Good fit in the ear and does block outside nose. Cable is plenty long enough for computer or iPad use.","Sony MDREX10LP\/BLK In-Ear Headphones. WOW. Exactly what I've been looking for. It is an exact fit for my ears. I'm no sound expert, but the music is perfect. I use this at the gym and they haven't fallen out once during hard cardio sessions.","ear phones. This was given as a gift to my child and she\/he loved the sound that it produces.  Also likes how they fit the ear.","I love these headphones. I love these headphones, I keep buying them. Problem is they don't seem to last very long. One ear always ends up dying on me. I love the fit so much I keep coming back.","Good sound, low price. I go through lots of ear buds and bought these to support my music habit. They fit my ears nicely and the sound is comparable to the $129 pair I bought before it went through the washer and dryer...","Nice Headsets and Great Color. Good sound, fit, color and quality. I like the way the the cables are evenly spread with adjustable cable separation. The headsets can be used in the spa as long as the ear buds are not immersed in water. The price is right.","Hate the way they fit. I used to order Sony's \"Sweet Little Buds\" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement. The sound quality is really pretty good for the money. For less than $10 you really can't complain.  I really have a problem with the way these fit. They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time. Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable.","Ear headphones. I am so amazed at the tremendous bass and sound coming from these\r\r\r\nheadphones. Great price, and finally buds that fit my ear properly. I plan\r\r\r\nto purchase two more pair before they are all out.","Real Crapola. Not only is the wire so flimsy that I fear to use it outdoors, but I have tiny ear canals and they shipped with only one small fitting.  Sort of useless.  The sound from my HTC solidly built earbuds is far better and after a year, they are still like new. I bought these overpriced commodity buds because people with auditory challenges appeared to praise them in the main.","Good for the cost. These ear phones work well and are holding up well. My daughter uses them at home so we have not tried them when doing activity yet but the sound is good and they fit well. They came with extra buds.","These don't disappoint. These are without a doubt, some of the best IEMs I've ever used. They fit perfectly, they can be used for basically any genre of music, they're clear, have surprisingly notable bass capabilities, and, for the price, cannot be beat by many other IEMs on the market. Kudos to you, Sony.","Nice but cords are too long for active wear.... The quality of sound is fine and the additional ear bud sizes offer a good selection to fit in your ear comfortably.  My only complaint is that the cords are too long.  I use these connected to my Nano when I'm working-out and I have 4 feet of cord I'm constantly fighting with.  I'm going to have to get some wire strippers and cut a section out and rejoin.","Don't waste your money. Very poor sound quality. No bass and damping total volume. Very disappointed. I have owned and enjoyed 3 pairs of SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds, which have great sound and fit. They don't seem to be available anymore.","Good sounding very affordable headphones.. The headphones are very nice for the price.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI can be very hard on headphones that I wear to work; I always seem to catch the cord on something and it rips them from my ear. Eventually they quit working; imagine that. I needed a headphone that was affordable enough to not cause me anxiety when I ruined them.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese fit comfortably and have surprising sound. I would definitely buy these again.","Backwards?. Work great!  Sound awesome, and the length is ideal for what I use them for...but found that the L fits much better in my right ear, and the R in my left.  Strange!","2 years and going. I got these in 2013 I think. Writing this in 2015. Just yesterday I was cleaning them and I messed up and the left side stopped working. So I went like s***, 2 years, gota order new ones. So I ordered some other brand and just this morning discovered they're still working fine.\r\r\r\nNo question there about durability.\r\r\r\nSometimes I forget they are on because they fit so nicely.\r\r\r\nBass is good, just the right amount. The highs get kinda tweazy on highest volumes. Mids are great.","Very nice pair of ear buds. Very nice pair of ear buds.  They sound great and fit great and are good to sleep with as well.. bought for my husband and he loves them.","Very good sound quality and snug fit.. This product comes with replaceable rubber pieces to customize the fit, which is great because many other competitive products don't fit my ear well.  Great price for very good sound.","Excellent inexpensive use and abuse headphones.. Excellent inexpensive use and abuse headphones.\r\r\r\nPros:\r\r\r\nThey have really crisp and clear sound.\r\r\r\nThey fit comfortably in my ears no discomfort even wearing them while sleeping.\r\r\r\nInexpensive, use them, abuse them, buy a new pair.\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\nSlightly flimsy, they will not last forever, but at that price you can hardly expect that.","Uncomfortable. These headphones are still going strong after I've had them for about a year. They have good sound quality and fit snug in the ear to drown out background noise. The only downside is that they can become uncomfortable after wearing them for a bit, even just 15 minutes.","Great value. Considering their price, these earphones are a great value. No, they don't sound as well as my Sennheisers, which cost me more than ten times. They fit nicely in my ears but I don't like the unequal length of the left\/right ear cables. I find this design to be a nuisance.","If you're sick of cheap headphones, these are a little bit better. If you don't want to spend $250 on headphones that fit in your ear and are sick of buying the cheap imitation knockoffs that cost $0.01 with $.99 shipping charges, you might be satisfied with these product. They kind of hurt my ear at first but then I realized I hadn't put on the little clear\/white ear fitting covers on. Once I put those on they didn't hurt my ear as much and it was easier to hear the music."]}]},{"comments":[{"comment_id":5052,"comment":"This product is OK - you can buy similar quality ....

I looked at an number of other options for NC headphones and ended up going with the Bose.  The noise cancelling is incredible and they are very comfortable.  I don't know a person that owns these and is disappointed in the performance.","Eh. Noise cancelling feature is nice, but the sound sucks","best noise cancelling headphones. I purchased these after much debate and more than a few recommendations.  I am glad I finally pulled the trigger on them.  They make flying on a plane so much easier as all that engine noise just goes away.  Now these are not \"noise isolating\" so they won't really drown out voices since the cancellation algorithm doesn't see that as \"noise.\" Nut even so it will mute them a little bit so they aren't as noticeable.","requires batteries to work.. spend ~300$ on a headset and having the spend as much on battery is not a good investment.\r\r\r\nThe device work well though, but they should have made it work without the battery as well, even it the noise cancelling if off.","Great for air travel.. Very good noise cancelation.  Better than average sound, not quite as good sound quaility as my HiFiMan but not in the same price category.  These are just great for travel.  Purchased for flying, you know, crying babies, people playing music and video games without head phones, etc.  You can also just wear them in noise cancelling mode and they definitely quiet things down.  Very pleased.  A little bulky for traveling but lightweight and comfortable.","Good Headphones. The headphones are extremely comfortable on the ears. When you turn on the noise cancelling switch, it blocks out nearly all of my surrounding sound so that I only hear what's playing on my mac or phone. When I'm not playing music and I use it for complete silence, I can still hear some things. If I'm in a coffee shop, I will still hear people talking, however I can't understand their entire conversation, it'll just sound muffled. Of course for the price I would've thought the noise-cancelling would be better, but I still like the headphones.","good sound not as comfortable as i remember. I tried on several of these headphones in the stores. They were the most comfortable I had ever worn.  Sound is great and noise cancelling is excellent but after wearing for 20-30 minutes they start to hurt my ears.  I do have big ears and they stick out from my head so I guess it is partially my fault.","Great!. These headphones are great. The noise-cancelling is awesome. I can still hear someone talk, but I cannot hear the fans on my tower system. Great for focusing on coding. At first, I regretted not getting the wireless version, but now I think I made the right choice, as wireless has issues of its own. This unit lasts about a week or so on a single AAA-battery, and let's you know the battery's dead with a sort of \"popping\" sound. Just keep a package of fresh batteries near your desk & you'll be fine.","Fantastic!. Bought these before a long international flight and was very impressed.  The sound quality is good, but the noise cancelling is almost magic.  It almost completely eliminates engine noise when on an airplane.  I also use them in my office to eliminate the noise from the large vent directly above my desk.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI was also impressed with the various cables and adapters included with the headphones.  The case also includes a small mesh pocket - presumably for extra batteries, but my ipod Nano fits in their perfectly as well.","Pretty Good. Pretty good headset.  I use them on my computer and they are quite a bit louder than my other ($50 headphones).  This is nice, the sound cancelling isn't anywhere near as effective as I expected.  They basically remove a lot of the ambient noise but you'll still hear even relatively quiet sounds happening around you.  I also use this set as a headset while flying with an adapter and the noise cancelling doesn't do much, though they are very light and comfortable.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI'm glad I purchased them, use them daily and would definitely recommend.","Excellent product. Mainly use the headphones while traveling on airplanes. Does an excellent job of cancelling out the constant drone of the jet engines and the miscellaneous noises in the cabin. When used in conjunction with an ipod, almost all the noise is eliminated. However, if they announce that the plane is about the crash, you may not hear it.","The Greatest. I really enjoy these although they are pricey.  I use them in a communications environment.  The noise cancelling works very well.  I wish someone would come up with some headphones that could be powered via the audio cable.  I end up going through a lot of batteries.","Just buy this FIRST!. Okay, for years I've wanted the Bose noise-cancelling headphones, but I kept buying cheap, and not so cheap knockoffs. I must have 4 sets of noise-cancelling headphones in a rubbermaid tote labelled \"headphones\". Finally, before my last trip, I just went for it. What a difference! I wasted a lot of dough on the rubbermaid tote phones, but I've found my thrill at last. And the case they give you for storing the phones is awesome. 6 stars!","Excellent headphones!. I debated for awhile about the Beats Studio by Dr. Dre and the Bose.  The one thing that put me over the edge is the noise cancelling quality and the remote iPhone\/iPod control for volume and functions.  I'm very glad I did, as I couldn't be happier with the Bose purchase.  As for quality for a $300 headphone, it's hard to tell right now, as it is plastic, but the sounds quality is superb!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHigh recommended!!!","best headphones I've ever owned. Fantastic noise cancelling capabilities.  Any constant noise is eliminated.  Voices not as much, but turn on some music and you're in your own world.  I can't compare against any competitors since I haven't tried them, but the reviews when I bough this indicated it had the best noise-cancelling qualities.  I occasionally forget to turn off the switch and it runs through a battery, so I recommend getting some eneloop batteries and a lacross bc700 charger, so you don't feel like you're wasting money on batteries.","awesome. I saw some videos compare this headphone with Beat on Youtube. then I think this is the right one I should buy. noise cancelling is so good!","VERY GOOD. this is a very good headphones,noise cancelling and sound is very quality. BOSE is very good.\r\r\r\nI like this product very much.","Great sound, awesome on airplanes and everyday listening.. Bought these to replace the previous generation Bose headphones I had.  Supposedly better noise cancelling and sound quality.  I guess it does seem to do a better job of cancelling outside noise, but I'm don't have an audiophile ear to really make out better sound quality.  No complaints so five stars from me.","Needs some BASS. Best headphone I have ever owned but they are severely missing some bass. When I say some I mean some, even a little would be appreciated but they have almost no bass what so ever.\r\r\r\nThe noise cancelling is very effective, on flights I often just have them on with no music playing just so that I can get some quiet.\r\r\r\nIf you listen to music that thrive on good bass then I would not recommend these.\r\r\r\nBut if you don't care about bass then any other headset would be the wrong choice!","Battery Required. Please be aware that you can't listen even *without* the noise cancelling if your battery dies.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe battery that came with them (I know, I should have used a fresh one) died twenty minutes into a three hour flight.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNot cool.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAlso, it's such a *small* battery.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWould be so much better if they looked into solar powering these things...\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWish I had returned these even though they work great *with* the battery because I have enough to remember in my everyday life without having to worry about a battery for my headphones, but alas, I missed my window.","Amazing!. Bought it as a gift for my brother! He fell in love with it. Could not believe what great sound it has as well as the noise cancelling feature that is ideal for his travels and love for music. Great gift!","Flaking earpieces and headband. Noise cancelling is good, and I like the sound, but considering how much it costs, you think Bose would use better material when constructing the unit.  The headband and earpieces essentially \"flaked\" apart, leaving black crud everywhere..sad...","Great sound quality. Love the sound quality, very clear.  I think calling any headphone Noise Cancelling is a little deceptive, but Bose probably does the best job out there.  Engine noise fades to the background.  Loud announcements are muffled enough so they're not so obnoxious.  Can still hear squealing children, but at least it's not so grating.  Really a bonus when traveling by air.","but the best noise cancelling I've heard. Eats up batteries a bit quickly, but the best noise cancelling I've heard; wear all day every day at work.","I like it.. Noise cancelling is great and it's the most comfortable pair I recall ever having.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe biggest drawback I see is that they don't work as regular headphones when the noise cancelling is turned off, like another brand of nc headphones I've had.  These build up pressure and emit a slight hiss that I don't want to put up with when there's no background noise.  It's also a power hog.  Get a lot of batteries or rechargeables.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI got mine used for a big discount, and highly recommend Unclaimed Baggage Center for their customer service.","The best headphones on the market!. I tried many different types of headphones and earbuds. Looking for the best quality audio response and and noise cancelling.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese headphones just work for me.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros- Great quality audio and noise canceeling, Lighweight. Easy to use\r\r\r\nCons - No Android phone adapter (works only on Iphone). Audio not the loudest I've heard. Price.","as advertised. If you have never heard the noise cancelling feature of these headphones you are missing something!\r\r\r\nThe sound from background noise is totally muffled whether you are listening to music or not.\r\r\r\nVery relaxing!\r\r\r\nThe actual speakers are as good or better than other non noise cancelling headphones\r\r\r\nA bit expensive, but worth it!","Nice but the ANC hurts my eardrums. I had these for a year and liked them at first. But over time I noticed that my eardrums sometimes hurt from the active noise cancelling, but there was no way to turn it off without still getting audio. I just couldn't use these anymore for regular music listening.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI went with the Sennheiser PXC 450, and think they are superior to the Bose.","... -but the noise cancelling and sound quality are very good.. Makes my ears \"sweat\" after an hour or so -but the noise cancelling and sound quality are very good.","Not Impressed. I read so many glowing reviews. I was expecting fantastic noise cancelling. I am not impressed. The noise cancelling is not that much better than my $70 Audio Technica earbuds. The construction of the earpiece mounts looks weak. The battery compartment seems flimsy. For as much as these cost, they should be better. I returned them for a refund.","needs batteries!  cannot recharge.. what?  noise cancelling headphones that i can't charge?  what the hell is that?  i had to buy a boat load of triple a batteries.","Great Noise Cancelling Headphones.

But once you've heard the sound from the SMs, few can compare, and these just didn't stand up in that department.  Otherwise, they were fine.  Good big ear cups, good build quality, can fold for easy storage and travel, and can keep unwanted sound out like no one's business.","Breaking down after a couple years.. As an owner of the QC-15's for over two years, I can say the sound quality is good overall.  When the ambient noise is too great to overcome, the constant popping on and off is annoying.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAdditionally, the ear pads are falling apart, the cords are breaking, and the sound quality has diminished over time.  I started noticing the degradation about a year ago.  Keep in mind though, I've used them a LOT.  Not worth $250, but they are decent.  I'd try as many as you possibly can before settling.","Four Stars. Nice but a bit overpriced. You're paying for the noise reduction.

I bought a decent, lower-priced set of sound-cancelling earphones by another manufacturer a few years ago. What a waste! The sound quality of these Bose earphones is truly amazing.

I'm hearing things I just assumed one could not hear outside of the concert hall. I am so glad I finally bought these.","Entering the cone of silence. The more I buy\/use Bose products, the more impressed I am. Noise cancellation is phenominal; you can't even hear yourself breathing.

Well worth the money.","Perfect travel \/ office headphones. Very effective noise isolation - lightweight & comfortable. Compact and well protected when stored in the included case.

A little bit muddy  in the middle.","Fantastic!. Bought these before a long international flight and was very impressed.  The sound quality is good, but the noise cancelling is almost magic.  It almost completely eliminates engine noise when on an airplane.  I also use them in my office to eliminate the noise from the large vent directly above my desk.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI was also impressed with the various cables and adapters included with the headphones.  The case also includes a small mesh pocket - presumably for extra batteries, but my ipod Nano fits in their perfectly as well.","Disappointed. Very Disappointed. Disappointed. Very Disappointed. For first 2 weeks I really liked the sound quality and Noise canceling. However, after 2 weeks suddenly Music sound ripped at random point.

I have had these for about two years now and they have really come in handy for myself and my wife.  They really do cancel out most background noise.  Great for long plane trips, vacuuming the floor, putting the other person's TV show off your radar as you browse the web, etc.  Pretty conspicuous for use in public places but when you have to have a break from what is happening with sound around you, these headphones work.  Sound quality for music is fine, as expected from Bose.","Excellent headphones!. I debated for awhile about the Beats Studio by Dr. Dre and the Bose.  The one thing that put me over the edge is the noise cancelling quality and the remote iPhone\/iPod control for volume and functions.

But if you do not own a BW or Paradigm reference speakers or $500 headphones, Bose will be a big leap for you in terms of sound.\r\r\r\nBut what makes these headphones a joy to use is the noise cancellation. Its black magic. its that good! Everything sounds better, because you can hear it properly. Even at home, its a big help. Humming refigerators, rattling dishwashers, mixer blenders, all of it just disappears. Its awesome!","Great sound, awesome on airplanes and everyday listening..

I bought the in ear buds and Iv'e had these for a year now and the sound quality just isn't worth what I paid for it (300.00). I might pay 80.00 for these but that is all. Seriously, sound quality is ok at best. The noise canceling works pretty good; about all I can say for these. I'll never buy Bose again. They are an overpriced brand.","Perfect sound for music. I chose this headphones because y fly a lot, I use it on the airplanes and the quality of that sound whit the noise cancelation function is perfect.","Great Headphones for Air Travel. This is my second set of Bose headphones. While I love my QC3's, an ear injury meant I could no longer use an \"on the ear\" type of headphone. These were a good replacement, but not a perfect one. QC3 definitely sound better than these. these have more of a \"tinny\" sound to them, and heavy bass drum make then sound almost like a blown car speaker....not the excellent quality I've been used to with Bose over the years.

Forget Beats by Dr. Dre, no matter how hyped up they are.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNothing beats these headphones. From their sound quality to unsurpassed noise cancellation... From their comfort to their battery life... I am a Bose QC QuietComfort guy for as long as they exist.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe extra cable that can open iTunes on Apple devices, control their volume while providing a built-in mic is an excellent perk.

I have had these for roughly 24 hours and let me say they are superb! I initially bought the Audio Technica ANC7B and sent them back due to poor sound quality, these are miles apart in sound.

The remote works seamlessly.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe old adage that says you get what you pay for is so true!

It worked great on planes.  Greatly reduced noise.  But for a headphone I seldom used and it dies in 14 months for $300.  This is one of the worse electronic buys ever.  It's in awesome shape.  It just would not turn on and I even went out to buy a brand new battery.  Very poor quality.  Last time I will buy Bose product.","What's all the fuss about?. They're quite comfortable--sort of: they're loose, and they move around, so it feels like they're going to fall off. They do a decent job with mid range. Bass is dramatically overdone.

Great for long plane trips, vacuuming the floor, putting the other person's TV show off your radar as you browse the web, etc.  Pretty conspicuous for use in public places but when you have to have a break from what is happening with sound around you, these headphones work.  Sound quality for music is fine, as expected from Bose.","not enough noise reduction. If you expect to work in silence or listen to your music without hearing the coffee shop music in the background, these headphones won't do that.  The Starbucks is still very loud and clear!  ugghhh!!","Disappointed. I have seen these Bose headphones on airplanes for many years. The alleged benefit was very appealing to me - cut out the continuous background noise.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI finally bought a pair. They do cut out the background noise, but they are so tight that they hurt my head after a few minutes. I can't wear them. $300 down the rat hole !","Great sound quality. Love the sound quality, very clear.  I think calling any headphone Noise Cancelling is a little deceptive, but Bose probably does the best job out there.  Engine noise fades to the background.  Loud announcements are muffled enough so they're not so obnoxious.  Can still hear squealing children, but at least it's not so grating.  Really a bonus when traveling by air.","I like it.. Noise cancelling is great and it's the most comfortable pair I recall ever having.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe biggest drawback I see is that they don't work as regular headphones when the noise cancelling is turned off, like another brand of nc headphones I've had.  These build up pressure and emit a slight hiss that I don't want to put up with when there's no background noise.  It's also a power hog.  Get a lot of batteries or rechargeables.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nI got mine used for a big discount, and highly recommend Unclaimed Baggage Center for their customer service.","as advertised. If you have never heard the noise cancelling feature of these headphones you are missing something!\r\r\r\nThe sound from background noise is totally muffled whether you are listening to music or not.\r\r\r\nVery relaxing!\r\r\r\nThe actual speakers are as good or better than other non noise cancelling headphones\r\r\r\nA bit expensive, but worth it!","Another great Bose product.

The headphones and noise reduction were very good, but I expected them to completely eliminate any background noise. Unfortunately dogs barking still bled through.","Great sound with no background. I use the Bose headset to kill the noise on long airline flights.  It does an unbelievably good job of producing the recorded sound and blocking the extraneous noise.  Worked so well I tried it in the dentist's office but found the noise there is generated internally and can't be blocked.

The headband and earpieces essentially \"flaked\" apart, leaving black crud everywhere..sad...","Good passive headphones are better.. It's ok.  But not _nearly_ as good at noise cancellation as these much cheaper passive headphones:  3M Peltor X-Series Over-the-Head Earmuffs, NRR 31 dB, One Size Fits Most, Black X5A. You can put earbuds under the passive ones and you get great music and huge sound reduction.  Much better effect and much better price than these Bose active phones.","Three Stars. great on planes.  not as quiet as I had hoped but much better than nothing","Great Headphones for Air Travel. This is my second set of Bose headphones. While I love my QC3's, an ear injury meant I could no longer use an \"on the ear\" type of headphone. These were a good replacement, but not a perfect one. QC3 definitely sound better than these. these have more of a \"tinny\" sound to them, and heavy bass drum make then sound almost like a blown car speaker....not the excellent quality I've been used to with Bose over the years. Excellent for movies and music without much bass.","Not Impressed. I read so many glowing reviews. I was expecting fantastic noise cancelling. I am not impressed. The noise cancelling is not that much better than my $70 Audio Technica earbuds. The construction of the earpiece mounts looks weak. The battery compartment seems flimsy. For as much as these cost, they should be better. I returned them for a refund.","Not sure it's worth the price but still very happy with these. I love how they did NOT hard wire the cord into the headphones. I did not realize I'd belted the cord into my airplane seat so somehow I managed to pull the cord out of the headphones.

I am glad I finally pulled the trigger on them.  They make flying on a plane so much easier as all that engine noise just goes away.

I got the headset for travel and to use at work. On the aircraft, it significantly cuts down on the engine noise. Works as advertised! I can listen to movies at normal volume.","Fantastic!. Bought these before a long international flight and was very impressed.  The sound quality is good, but the noise cancelling is almost magic.

I wanted these headphones for a couple of years and then bought them for my birthday.  I was really disappointed... the sound quality was not what I expected.  Yes, there was enormous noise cancelling capabilities, but the music sounded like I was using a very cheap pair of headphones.  I hate to be critical of Bose... but these just didn't do these for me.","The best noise cancelling on the market.  I tried 15 different kinds.. Tried many noise cancelling, and while these are too expensive, they are hands down the best.  I cannot believe that no other vendor can even come close.

I don't see the point of a product that needs a wire in todays electronic wireless world, not for this price, I sadly returned it. FYI, I'm a huge Bose fan and I have their systems in my home and cars. Folks should also know that noise cancelling is more like noise muffling.","Stopped working after 2 years....consider another brand. Great noise-cancelling headphones but after two years of usage the left ear bud stopped working due to a poor solder joint. Spending $300 on headphones and having this issue occur right outside of the extended warranty period has left me bitter on the quality of products Bose is producing.\r\r\r\nI would recommend buying another vendor for noise-cancelling headphones...as Bose is more focused on volume of products over quality.","Very valuable for discounted price!. I loved the nosie cancelling technology from the bose.\r\r\r\nI`m not expert in that field but I had purchased several headphones with noise cancelling and product from bose is the best.\r\r\r\nIf this is too much budget for someone, i recommend the headphones noise cancelling from jbl.","Noise cancelling very effective but not perfect. Noise cancelling works very well no only on white noises but also on speech and music.  However, at high frequency the cancelling is less effective.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMusic playback quality is good.  The frequency response is different when noise cancellation is turned on or off.  Overall, high frequency response is lacking, making the sound a bit muffled.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe headset is light and comfortable.  The carrying case is a plus.  However, mechanical design can be improved to make the headphone more compact when folded.","A must have for Commuters. I bought the QC15 back in 2010 and I was immensely disappointed at the Sound Quality. After trying the QC25 at bestbuy for a few minutes, I was more than impressed with the Quality of the sound. The build quality is also superv, the Noise Cancelling feature is a MUST for those of us that commute to work on a daily basis,  A must have for music lovers!","Great Noise-Cancelling, Faulty Connection. This is the 2nd pair of Bose headphones I've gone through. I bought the newest model and returned because the Bluetooth connection was bad across devices even using their software. This pair I thought would fare better with wired connection as a fail-safe, but within about 6 months the right earcup has a faulty connection, outside of warranty of course.\r\r\r\nNever using Bose again; would not recommend this brand.","Can wear all day. Replacing my disintagrated quiet comfort 1that I had for 7 years. Very very comfortable which is the primary reason for sticking with Bose. As far as audio quality, there is some markedly difference between powered and bypass. In bypass, ie noise cancelling off, it sounds rather flat and very low.\r\r\r\nWith noise cancelling on, the audio is very bright and articulate. There are some amplifier artifacts notable.\r\r\r\nGood enough for day to day use. Not recommended for studio work.","Great noise cancelling headphones.. These are fantastic headphones.

I love these. I've owned many pairs of noise cancelling headphones, Bose is by far the best. Bose is the only pair that I haven't destroyed in 3 months. They feel cheap but are not in any way. I work in a factory and I truly feel I am saving my hearing (and why im so hard on these). Recently used these so I could sleep in the car on a long road trip where the driver was cranking dance music. If they fit tighter, theyd work better (pushing in on them makes them work better)","Great noise cancellation headphones.. These headphones are great.  The noise cancelling is amazing.  No wonder the NFL coaches use Bose headsets.  I moved into a crowded office environment where you can hear people talking anywhere in the room.  This headset greatly reduces the noise and allows me to concentrate while at work.","Five Stars. OMG these are awesome!

Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones.\r\r\r\nI have always wanted Bose headphones--I love their products and have used them for years. I am not a fan of clunky headphones, but these feel comforting and cozy on my head and the sound is incredible. I feel like I am wherever the music is.","Four Stars. Great sound. Noise cancelling feature works nicely. But ear feels uncomfortable when wearing it for too long.","Worth the Money. I've had a number of noise cancelling headphones\/ear buds etc.. and didn't want to spend the type of money these Bose cost.  However, I finally bit the bullet and bought these.  Wow.. what a difference when comparing to the cheap versions I've had.  The world of noise just goes away.  I've used these on 3 airplane trips and it sure makes a BIG difference especially on the noisy Regional Jets.  These are very comfortable and well built.","As good as they get.. The best of all the noise cancelling headphones, but don't expect miracles.\r\r\r\nI haven't found a single set of noise cancelling headphones that really cancels all the noise. I guess I expect too much. I want something I can put on and I'm instantly in the \"cone of silence\" where I can't hear anybody talking to me. These muffle engine noise and any other noise as long as the noise is constant.","Get peace of mind.. I LOVE IT!! I won't fly without it!  I just wish the bluetooth version had come out when i upgraded.  I've been a fan of these Bose Noise Cancelling headsets for over 15 years now!!  It filters out all the jet noise!  I am rested and relaxed when we arrive.  No longer am I tired from traveling.","Mediocre sound at the best. Honestly, the only great feature of this headphone is the noise cancelling.  Everything else is mediocre at the best.  Very little sound stage and the volume sounds muted, suggesting that I might need an amplifier as suggested by some comments here.  Not worth the $300 price.","Comfortable. A good set  of headphones.

No issues with call quality when using the mic, everyone could hear me clearly.  Battery life is also great.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDo NOT use these in high winds.  That is what I did, and BOOM...the right side suddenly went staticy and went out.  Not very rugged for $300.","Ear Cushions Don't Last. I bought these for long haul flights but then started using them on a daily basis. The ear cushions fell apart after about eight months daily use. Replacement ear cushions are $35. Reviewers on the Bose website report the replacements are also of inferior quality. The stitching fails and the foam cushion falls apart. I have higher expectations of $300 headphones. Is this designed obsolescence? They're electrically sound. I like the noise cancelling feature, but on long haul flights you will also probably need extra batteries.","Bose quality on your head. Nuff said.. Excellent sound quality and noise cancelling in a headset you can wear comfortably all day.","It hurts my ears :(. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that headphones start to hurt my ears after aprox. 30 minutes of listening. Sound is great, noise cancelling great, but comfort of wearing is poor.

Haven't had a chance to try them on an airplane yet, but they even block out loud wives effectively at home!  My only complaint is battery life!  Even if I don't need noise cancelling, I have to run it, since amplitude and frequency response suffer if it's off.  And the battery only lasts a few days when used extensively.","Try before you buy. Too much pressure on the ears with the noise-canceling activated. Not pressure from the earcups, from the \"noise cancelling\" sound.","Bose quiet headphones. Takes you to a nice quiet, private place when you're crowded in your seat on a plane... or waiting room... or anywhere you need a little peace.  Of course, Bose wrote the book on the noise cancelling tech.  Comes with a nice case.  Very happy.

I wanted these headphones for a couple of years and then bought them for my birthday.  I was really disappointed... the sound quality was not what I expected.  Yes, there was enormous noise cancelling capabilities, but the music sounded like I was using a very cheap pair of headphones.

The lateral pressure on the head is a bit too tight for me. While it does hold the headphones securely to the head, it is a little uncomfortable. Would be great if the amount of pressure on the cranium was adjustable.","Headphones. This was a Christmas gift last year.  It muffles the engine noise well and has good sound quality.  The case holds the earphones, a connector cord, a plug adapter (1 to 2 prongs) as well as my ipod and an extra battery.","Wonderful sound quality, top notch noise canceling, burns through batteries.. These are great headphones, and the noise canceling is top quality. When my cat gets annoying and starts meowing really loudly, I just flip the switch and hear total silence.

However, at high frequency the cancelling is less effective.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nMusic playback quality is good.  The frequency response is different when noise cancellation is turned on or off.  Overall, high frequency response is lacking, making the sound a bit muffled.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe headset is light and comfortable.  The carrying case is a plus.  However, mechanical design can be improved to make the headphone more compact when folded.","A must have for Commuters. I bought the QC15 back in 2010 and I was immensely disappointed at the Sound Quality. After trying the QC25 at bestbuy for a few minutes, I was more than impressed with the Quality of the sound. The build quality is also superv, the Noise Cancelling feature is a MUST for those of us that commute to work on a daily basis,  A must have for music lovers!","Can wear all day. Replacing my disintagrated quiet comfort 1that I had for 7 years. Very very comfortable which is the primary reason for sticking with Bose. As far as audio quality, there is some markedly difference between powered and bypass. In bypass, ie noise cancelling off, it sounds rather flat and very low.\r\r\r\nWith noise cancelling on, the audio is very bright and articulate. There are some amplifier artifacts notable.\r\r\r\nGood enough for day to day use. Not recommended for studio work.","Bose blew me away!. I am a Music lover. I wanted to buy a pair of headphones that I knew would be of high quality and enhance the sound of my music. I couldn't be more happy with my choice. They provide a rich sound quality as well as convenient noise cancellation. Given the popularity of the Bose brand, I was presently surprised at how reasonably priced theyare.","The sound quality is also pretty good and they are comfortable. Well...I didn't think it would work. But these headphones have managed to nearly completely block out the noisy neighbors that live above me. If I could give them 10 stars I would. The sound quality is also pretty good and they are comfortable. I wore them for 5 hours tonight, and feel like I could go longer. Now, if I could only figure out how to block the noise out after I go to bed...but that's another topic altogether.","A couple of caveats. The earphone are excellent for sound and sound cancelling, as have been the previous versions and as many others have noted.  The  folding design is somewhat cumbersome, however, and the cushions are an issue.  One of mine started coming apart after about two years. As one can see, replacements sets are sold, confirmation that there is a quality control problem here.  I super-glued mine back together, but it was tedious. Except for these two concerns, the 25's are fine.","Best damn noise canceling out there.. This is the 3rd pair of noise canceling headphones I have tried and there is no contest, these are absolutely the best.  They are waaaay more comfortable (nicer, softer pads) than the Klipsch and the audiotronics and the sound quality is great as well.  Without noise canceling on, there are better headphones out there, but I found I use the noise canceling every time I use them.","Superior noise cancelling headphones at a premium price.  Travelers choice.. Good quality sound.  Not superior.  Excellent noise cancellation sets them apart.  Good quality construction.  Well thought out features.  Very good battery life.  Very nice case and packaging.","The sound quality is pretty good, but the overall quality is poor. The sound quality is pretty good, but the overall quality is poor, for $300.

I agree with many viewers who complained about its quality.  Bought it a few years ago, and did not use it for a long time.  Then my daughter started to use it.  It lasted for only a few months, though it sounded wonderful when it worked.  In total, its lief expectancy was about ten months.","Five Stars. Sound quality is great. Noise Canceling is outstanding","Worse sound quality than $6 in-ear head buds.

I received these and they broke within 1 minute.  For that minute, they sounded great and noise cancelled very well.  However, the connector into the headphone would cause the ear phones to cut in and out when you touched or turned them.  I hope this is not an indication of the quality.  I have sought a replacement from Amazon and will let you know of my new review based on the new pair.","Great sound, terribnle microphone.

I was skeptical of this entire genre of headphones.  #1 the sounds is great.  #2 the noise cancelling on a plane or in an office not only works but works really well.  I could not hear the plane but could have a conversation without shouting.  ONly reason they are a 4 is after a few hours of straight use they get hot.  Might be expected but I was unhappy to have to take them off and listen to the rest of the world while cooling off my ears.","Great headphones!. If you can afford these, get them! I bought them for an overnight 8-hour trip to South America.  I knew the flight would be loud (can't stand the sound of engines or annoying, reluctant, job-hating-please-do-something-else flight attendants).  Needless to say, these headphones cancelled all noise and I slept like a baby!  Great for airplane travel and doing work involving heavy machinery.  I recently used these while pressure washing a roof and it was a surreal experience. Also, got a loud spouse you want to block out?  I will say no more!","Five Stars. Great quality! sound is good and noise canceling is what I needed","Great Deal on BOSE. I bought these at a huge discount Amazon was having on some p[roducts. I normally would not pay up0 for Bose products but could not pass this deal up. The phones work while mowing the lawn. Can barely hear then the tractor.

Everyone I know who has these loves them. The noise-canceling feature is pretty amazing and is really great for blocking out noise in cafes in addition to planes etc. Bought these for my dad for christmas and he loves them.

I can put these on and instantly the noisy terminal, the sounds of the plane, the crying children in a waiting room... all instantly gone replaced by my music of choice.  They are comfortable to wear for long periods and produce great sound.  I have noticed sounds in my favorite songs that I had never noticed before.  I highly recommend these.","Great headphone, except for little base and bad AAA battery design... can't recharge it. 3.5 stars would be more appropriate\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPros:\r\r\r\nGreat noise cancellation\r\r\r\nBeautiful Premium Design\r\r\r\nVery light and comfortable\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:\r\r\r\nNo Base...

Great sound and comfortable. Loved them.  Great sound and comfortable.  Quick delivery.","They work great to cancel out surrounding sounds. I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them. They work great to cancel out surrounding sounds, like our kids, when he's listening to music or working.","Great unless you have hair.. I wanted to like these.  They are comfortable, lightweight and sound good.  They continue to work at a reduced volume when the battery dies.  There is however -what is to me- a fatal flaw.  The design grabs your hair where they pivot.  I have ripped out countless strands of hair taking them off and Im sick of it.  I won't use them anymore.  I give them two stars because I suppose they are usable by someone without hair.","A little too tight on the head, otherwise excellent!. Very happy with these headphones. Exceptional noise canceling and very good sound quality. I was hesitant spending so much for headphones but the fact that the noise canceling works so well makes it well worth it. The lateral pressure on the head is a bit too tight for me. While it does hold the headphones securely to the head, it is a little uncomfortable. Would be great if the amount of pressure on the cranium was adjustable.","Great sounds and noise cancelling. Wore these on a plane for over 30 hours so far.

Great noise cancelling and sound (best on the market) but it is not bluetooth wireless for music. I don't see the point of a product that needs a wire in todays electronic wireless world, not for this price, I sadly returned it. FYI, I'm a huge Bose fan and I have their systems in my home and cars. Folks should also know that noise cancelling is more like noise muffling.","Garbage. If I could give 0 stars, I would. I treat these headphones better than most people treat their children. As a consumer, you spend $300+ on  headphones that don't last more than 60 hours; it sounds like a great investment. I recently purchased a set for my girlfriend which I will proceed to return. I think the most frustrating part of this experience is that I now have a 9 hour flight without headphones. I will need to purchase something else at the airport. Thanks Bose!!","Wonderful sound quality, top notch noise canceling, burns through batteries.. These are great headphones, and the noise canceling is top quality. When my cat gets annoying and starts meowing really loudly, I just flip the switch and hear total silence. My one issue is that the noise canceling burns through batteries like nobody's business, and I wish they could just charge by plugging in to a USB or something like that. Otherwise, amazing sound quality, bass is great but not overbearing, and comes with a handy carrying case.\r\r\r\nI have not tried the microphone, but I'm sure it's wonderful.","White noise. Weird white noise sound when i turn on the noise canceling function and the sound dosent sound as good with it on. but other than that it is a great product.","Great sound-a tight fit. Excellent, compact a little small-after x-country flight my ears were a little sore (and I don't have a big head).\r\r\r\nGreat sound, though.","Best damn noise canceling out there.. This is the 3rd pair of noise canceling headphones I have tried and there is no contest, these are absolutely the best.  They are waaaay more comfortable (nicer, softer pads) than the Klipsch and the audiotronics and the sound quality is great as well.  Without noise canceling on, there are better headphones out there, but I found I use the noise canceling every time I use them.","Four Stars. Great sound. Noise cancelling feature works nicely. But ear feels uncomfortable when wearing it for too long.","BOSE the gold standard in sound. Great battery life and sound! Can be a little pricy but you get what you pay for.","Five Stars. Sound quality is great. Noise Canceling is outstanding","Sound great...broke after 1 minute. I received these and they broke within 1 minute.  For that minute, they sounded great and noise cancelled very well.  However, the connector into the headphone would cause the ear phones to cut in and out when you touched or turned them.  I hope this is not an indication of the quality.  I have sought a replacement from Amazon and will let you know of my new review based on the new pair.","Great sound, terribnle microphone. Very comfortable, and for listening they have been great -- I've fallen asleep with them on in bed and on planes, and they are very durable.  The sound is notably better than any of my other headphones as well.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nHowever, they have been terrible for making phone calls.  People cannot hear me well - the microphones used in speaker phone built into the iPhone has much higher quality, and I end up not being able to use the Bose for call.","Good headphones. Does virtually nothing for reducing crying baby noise.. Pretty good headphones. Good, but not great sound quality. Greatly reduces constant noise sources (road noise, engine noise, airplane noise). Does virtually NOTHING to the noise generated by the crying baby seated near you.","Mediocre sound at the best. Honestly, the only great feature of this headphone is the noise cancelling.  Everything else is mediocre at the best.  Very little sound stage and the volume sounds muted, suggesting that I might need an amplifier as suggested by some comments here.  Not worth the $300 price.","Couldn't be happier with these headphones. Wirth the price.. Can't rave more about these headphones. The sound quality, especially base during movies such as The Hobbit, exceeds my expectations. Great for watching late-night movies without disturbing anyone yet still having a theatre quality experience.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe noise cancellation blocks out the sounds of my home hvac unit so I can watch movies and still keep cool\/warm.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nNOTE: It does tend to go quickly through the AAA battery that is required for the noise cancelation. Be sure to have a spare battery in the wonderfully durable case that comes with it.","Awesome, Pure Awesome!. Best headphones ever for the gym! They are so lightweight it's unreal. Sweat on them-wipe the ear cushions off, whatever. They block out the chatty person next to you on the elliptical or treadmill. I wear them for mowing and lawn work. The case with them is great. People can hear you just great on the microphone cable- for phone use. They can't tell you are not on the phone and you hear them clearly. The sound-music is so clear it's great. Very lightweight too.","Great sound. Too hot on the ears no it .... Great sound. Too hot on the ears no it has no give. Squeezes too hard on the head. I used them maybe 5 times.","Great sound but not a great fit for above average head and ear size.. I bought these as I have wanted a nice set of headphones. On the plus side they arrive quickly, looked great but didn't fit my head or ears I am large in size and these are made for normal sized people. The girlfriend and my son loved them, however, they were for me.","Great noise cancellation and sound!. Great headphones! Anyone who has an issue or a defect should just contact Bose directly for warranty service.","It hurts my ears :(. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that headphones start to hurt my ears after aprox. 30 minutes of listening. Sound is great, noise cancelling great, but comfort of wearing is poor. Im in love with Bose, but didn't expect this unpleasant annoyance.","Good headphones, poor value.. Sound is great, but build quality could be better. Headphone folding issue and the ear pads come apart easily even with careful use. For the money the build quality should last longer.","Great noise cancelling effect, great sound!. Bought for my 12-ur old daughter for the noise cancelling component for test taking in school.  Does not eliminate noise but muffled nicely for her to focus appropriately.  The bonus, the sound quality of the headphones for music and streaming video!!","Great headphones. These headphones are great.  They're my first over ear headphones and they're nothing but wonderful.  The sound is great and the noise cancellation is nice.  The noise cancellation works best for deeper background noises like an air conditioner or on a plane.","Best Bose headphones yet. I used to have Sennheiser noise-canceling headphones and while they sounded great, the base was terrible and the volume never got loud enough. These Bose headphones blow them out of the water - and they cost $200 LESS than the Sennheisers! My only gripe is that Bose regressed a bit and made the batteries non-rechargeable. But that is a minor gripe compared to how much they get right with these!","... will not believe the sound you get with these great muffs.. You will not believe the sound you get with these great muffs.","Five Stars. These headphones sound great with or without the noise cancellation!","Great noise cancellation, but mediocre sound quality. Noise cancellation is great, but the sound quality is only mediocre. It's too sharp, sometimes overwhelmingly sharp, in the midrange, with a distinct lack of deep bass. I mainly use this on airplanes, especially for listening to movies. I wouldn't buy it as an audiophile piece; you can get MUCH better sound for less money with most of the Sennheiser headphones going for $100-300.","Great sound!. I got this for my wife, she loves it.  I listened to it and found that it is better than the older Bose headset that I have been using.  I may have to get one of these for myself.","The headphones work great for noise cancelling but if you move too much. The headphones work great for noise cancelling but if you move too much, the wire comes loose from the headphones and you lose sound.

Sound quality is mediocre, about on par with other $25-$30 headphones. Everything about the headphones is on par with other non-branded headphones in this price range , the fit to head, manufacturing, etc. The one real plus that is unique is the fact that you can use them as Bluetooth headphones or corded headphones. .  .","Very good quality for the price.. I ordered these earphones after using the earbuds from the same manufacturer for three months.  The headphones have met our needs perfectly.  The sound produced by these earphones is very good.  I am an avid listener of different types of music from rock to classical but certainly not an audiophile. The headband is not of exceptional quality so I wonder about its lifespan.","Good sound, not so great construction.. Headphones only lasted about 30 days before breaking. The headband adjustment on one side stopped holding the earpiece in place after just two weeks of use, then the power button stopped working. I bought these as a gift for my nephew and while he loved the sound, the quality of the headphones doesn't seem up to daily use.","A+++ price, soubd, quality, battery life and pirtabiluty all get an A++.

I'll be getting a second pair.","great looking headphone for the cheap price. great looking inexpensive headphone .\r\r\r\nsound quality is unexped great quality headphone.","Comfortable, affordable and great looking over the ear wireless headphones. These are great so far. I've only had them a few weeks, but for affordable wireless headphones they are great. So far they hold their charge and sound awesome. I also like the look of the black ones. I didn't want to spend money on beats by dre or bose if I didn't like the look and feel of the over the ear headphones. I feel like I got a quality product at a affordable price.","My son loves them. I purchased these headphones for my son for his 11th birthday , he absolutely loves them he says they are boss whatever that means. He also thinks they sound better than my bluedio R+ legend that I have but what ever float's his boat. I think they have a sturdy build quality then my R+.They also sound pretty good as well. It would be great if bluedio would  make replacement head bands for there R+ legend head phones because mine has cracks in them for some reason.","The Best inexpensive Bluetooth headphones you can buy right now.. These pair well via Bluetooth. Main Pros: Inexpensive ($20), high playback time (40 hours - so I haven't ever had it die on me, in need of charging), snug (a bit low-profile), over ear design, rugged.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons: Sound quality can get a little tinny on the treble. Handles BASS pretty well, though.\r\r\r\nTight headpiece - My ears hurt after wearing these for a couple of hours. The headpiece is too tight and even though they can be adjusted, they will probably always be too snug.","not the worlds greatest, but not terrible. Battery life is nuts on these. I can only recall charging these up a grand total of 8 times in 8 months, with at least 1 hour of use per night average. Sound quality is what you paid for, not the worlds greatest, but not terrible, especially considering bluetooth.","Snapped heard strap. I'm pleased with sound quality but irritated that the head strap broke.  My daughter got some good use out of them but gee whiz. Bought in August.","Bluetooth Headphones. Impressed with the sound quality. Nice comfortable fit. They are as described. The one downfall are the function button as they are a bit flimsy and built with a low quality material.","I love the product and the sound quality.

They are uncomfortable as they press against your ears to your head.  They work for me as I just use them for a break occasionally from my earbuds.  Sound quality is less than average but I don't expect Beats or Bose for $20.  If you do, keep looking.  They work fine for what I need.","Three Stars. Got broken so easy, the quality is too bad but the sound quality is so good. It's okay.","sound quality is not that great. sound quality is not that great and also the range...but ok for the price i guess, maybe there is a better one out there\r\r\r\nin this price range","Great sound!  ...are a bit tight on the ears.. Awesome sound quality!  2 thumbs up for the sounds.  They are a bit tight though.  I actually broke the plastic band which is inside the leather casing, when I dropped them one day.  It still holds up okay, but they slide off my head easily now.  That was totally my fault.  I still love the sound even though I made a mistake.  My only complaint is.. they are SUPER tight at first.  Maybe in time they would get more comfortable. (?)","The Bluetooth connection is pretty impressive. The ear cups also do not pivot .... Not expecting much due to the affordability aspect of these headphones, but the sound quality is muddled with bass and highs are very weak. The Bluetooth connection is pretty impressive. The ear cups also do not pivot to conform to the round shape of your head, which can provide for a rather uncomfortable wearing experience if not positioned perfectly on your head.","Great Product!!. I love these headphones!  The bass is great and the sound qualitythey produce is great.  The battery life is good, and the bluetooth capability works well.  It connected to my android tablet without a problem.  These heaphones are well worth $35, and if I ever need a second pair, I would definitely buy tthem again.  It also shipped pretty fast.","Decent. Battery life is ridiculously awesome, very comfy.. Not the best sound quality, a lot of white noise as they aged, but very comfortable and the battery life is amazing - didn't have to charge for at least a week, using all day every day. Broke in half trying to stuff in a backpack in a hurry after 6 months, still think I got my money's worth.","Good quality sound. Good quality sound. Easy to pair, but FLIMSY. I broke the top part within a week of getting them. Tried to fix it with some tape. Kind of worked.","Worth more than its being sold for.. Better than Beats. I have had a set since December and decided that I liked them so much I had to buy a set for my wife and daughter. They last for ever in a charge don't know what the spec is but it gives it no justice. Sound quality is great and works as a head set so you can talk with it as well. I'm a simple guy and like a simple review this product works flawlessly","Bluedio. These headphones are good for the price. The sound quality is not as good as expensive headphones but they work well. The battery life on them is extremely good and I can use them for a long time before having to charge. I do not listen to headphones very often but they are great to have at a good price.","These are decent for the price.. These are decent for the price. Sound is pretty good, but I'm not happy with the way these one's fit. The one's that don't fold fit on my head much better. Outside of that they are pretty good. Battery life is great, sound quality is decent, but the build quality is a bit cheap. I would recommend the RevJams over these for sure, and the price is pretty close anyway.

Purchased for tween & teen. They are very happy. Would purchase again.","But sounds good.. Long lasting battery' stylish' style. Built quality kinda low. But sounds good.","Like listening to a cassette tape through a tin-can telephone. The bluetooth pairing functionality works just fine... but the sound quality is dogs***. I have no idea what good these headphones are, but they're certainly not for listening to music.","Very uncomfortable, ear phones do not swivel to cover the ear.. Recommend staying away from these as sound quality is not that good and build quality is not there either, I am returning these for Sony or Panasonic another trusted brand.  I have never seen a person with ears perfectly parallel to each other whIch is the only shape these cans can fit.","Good sound quality. Very good sound quality. \" What you may not notice is that we have adjusted the headband, based on Ergonomics theory, to fit all head sizes.\" But it does not fit my ears, after 15 mins. my ears begin to feel pain. I tried every way to adjust it but it would not work. I guess my ears are too big!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nUpdate, I opened up the ear pads and cut out the inside pad part. Now they fit over my ears with no problem. Of course this voided the warranty.","... bit tight on my head but sound quality is excellent. A bit tight on my head but sound quality is excellent","they are just as good quality and sound better than other headphones that cost .... I was not a believer till I bit the bullet and ordered these...they are just as good quality and sound better than other headphones that cost hundreds of dollars. Bass response is almost silly, they sound like you just strapped two floor speakers to your head! Separate amp built in so you can turn up higher than the source and built in EQ if the bass isn't your thing...awesome!","Amazing sound !!!. Wow, the quality and sound from these headsets do not add up to the price. I'm very satisfied with the sound, design and price. I would of gave them 5 stars but, the picture makes them look like a shiney metal, but their actually a dull metal.","Incredible sound. Incredible sound quality. Careful use, head band is plastic & broke four months, careful. Not happy.","Awesome sound.. Awesome sound.. Booming bass.. I referred a friend. He enjoys them & I will definitely buy another pair very soon. And sound quality is clear when talking on phone........ Go Bluedio.","Love them. Love these headphones!  They are comfy so I can use them all day.  You do have to adjust every once in a while but they don't hurt you like a lot of others do after longer wear, even with glasses on.  Battery life is excellent, hubby and I share them and it takes a few days to run down the battery.  Sound quality is great, much more than I expected.  Color is the same as the picture.  Set up is easy.","Affordable and Durable Bluetooth Headset. I purchased this headset for the ability to adjust while on your head into multiple positions since the ear pieces are on a swivel as well in order to fold them up. They work great! They also are Bluetooth, which is another big win for me. The sound quality is acceptable, however the microphone isn't the best for phone calls in a noisy environment. However for everyday use, these are excellent. Additionally the battery lasts for days, literally days!!!","Great Sound Need a Better Build Quality!!!. These Headphone are GREAT SOUNDING!!!!!  But the head band is plastic and breaks too easily... If they change the headband to metal I'd pay $10 or $15 more for the durability...","Great Sound, Easy to Use. My 10 y\/o son loves these.  They cancel noise without making him deaf to his parents and they provide excellent sound quality - at least by my son's standards.","Great sound,  poor design.. Excellent sound quality but they feel like they were made backwards. When you put them on the front way then they feel awkward but when you turn them around and put them on backwards they fit perfectly. It appears to be a design flaw that hurts my ears after about 10 minutes.","... changed my mind in many ways this product is excellent and the quality of sound is great better than .... I originally did a review on this headset but I have changed my mind in many ways this product is excellent and the quality of sound is great better than expected I was so happy with it that I even purchase a second set. Great job guys.","Good Quality headphones. Good Quality headphones, pairing is easy to Bluetooth devices. Only problem is sound quality. If you like the similar Beats head phones you will love these!

Good sound, great battery life can go all week without charging, build quality could use improvements however. The head band has a plastic core and it snapped on me near the left ear piece. I tried to repair but it didn't hold. On the plus side they are cheap enough to replace compared to the more expensive sets. The fit was ok, not perfect. For $30 its a good value but don't expect it to hold up to much punishment.","Love hate relationship.. I got these for Christmas and bought 5 other pair because they sound amazing. However every single pair have broken in the same place on the headband. It makes me sick. I love these headphones but in the end I can't put them on my head to listen to them and I keep buying them over and over expecting a different result. Never happens. Wish I could get them replaced with a metal headband and no plastic. The sound is better than Beats. But the quality of the material is kmart.","So many great features for iphone users!. I bought these for my sister as a present. They are AMAZING! She loves them. The sound quality is good. Bass is great. AND she can press a button on them and talk to siri on her iphone. As a result, she can control the iphone while it is in her pocket.

Still and excellent buy!","Maybe i have a big head?. The sound was nice. They have a funky design that makes more comfortable to wear them backwards. The build quality is cheap. I went to put the headphones on after about two months and one portion of the headband snapped.

It still holds up okay, but they slide off my head easily now.  That was totally my fault.  I still love the sound even though I made a mistake.  My only complaint is.. they are SUPER tight at first.  Maybe in time they would get more comfortable. (?)","Great price, good product. I have bought three of these so far. air used the first pair while cutting lawn. No noise cancelling, so not ideal. Sound ok and par for price. Durable. Battery lasted entire season without a charge.

The headphones are great, they have a SD Card slot so you can listen to your favorite songs, FM radio and really good sound.

The headphones are a little heavy and tight - so if used for an extended period of time, do feel a little tight around the ears. However, for a shorter period of time, they do keep out the noise and the sounds are excellent. The range is also good so much so that at the gym I almost forgot my Galaxy S6 Edge+ on the elliptical.

I didn't !!","Affordable and Durable Bluetooth Headset. I purchased this headset for the ability to adjust while on your head into multiple positions since the ear pieces are on a swivel as well in order to fold them up. They work great!

The automated voice kinda cracks me up whenever I hear it. Anyways, This is my 2nd BT headphones and it is an upgrade sound-wise, but trying to fit it on my head is another matter. They get the job done quite well when you get it fitted on your head.","Great headphones.. I love the fact that it gives you 30hrs of music. I can work out all week long in just one charge. The sound quality is really good. I have bought 4 more after the first one as gifts to my family members.","Afforable wireless headphone..

Good size. Stays on during workouts","Good bluetooth headphones Bad construction. These guys pair with my transmitter quickly and the sound quality is great.

Other party seemed to hear me clearly. Very good purchase, you will not regret it!!!!","Very good headphones for the price!. I opened this package for my own personal use.

There's a little bit of a delay with the sound other than that they work perfectly.","Nice little headset, I'm happy with this purchase.. I purchased 2 pairs of these, one for myself and one for my son. My son uses them more than I do, he takes them everywhere. The sound is pretty good, work well for using with phone and for listening to music. They arrived on time, and you can't beat the price for a set of wireless headphones. They fold up, have a neat little design to them. They could have a little better adjustment for how they fit on your head. Still a good purchase. I'm happy.","Very good quality for the price.. I ordered these earphones after using the earbuds from the same manufacturer for three months.  The headphones have met our needs perfectly.  The sound produced by these earphones is very good.  I am an avid listener of different types of music from rock to classical but certainly not an audiophile. The headband is not of exceptional quality so I wonder about its lifespan.","Good sound, not so great construction.. Headphones only lasted about 30 days before breaking. The headband adjustment on one side stopped holding the earpiece in place after just two weeks of use, then the power button stopped working. I bought these as a gift for my nephew and while he loved the sound, the quality of the headphones doesn't seem up to daily use.","Great for the price..

I will definitely consider buying them again.","Horrible hollow sound. I returned it the same day it was delivered. Horrible hollow sound. Sounds like a muffled hallway.

The buttons are hard to hit.","Bluetooth headphones at a Great Price. This is a nice Bluetooth Over the Ear Headphone set.  Good for when your on the go and don't want to use ear buds.  Easy connect and sound is very good.  I Highly recommend these headphones.","My son loves them. I purchased these headphones for my son for his 11th birthday , he absolutely loves them he says they are boss whatever that means. He also thinks they sound better than my bluedio R+ legend that I have but what ever float's his boat. I think they have a sturdy build quality then my R+.They also sound pretty good as well.

My daughter got some good use out of them but gee whiz. Bought in August.","Good product for $20. Good product for $20.  Connects super fast and has excellent battery life.  HOWEVER, they should be classified as \"on-ear\" and not \"over-the-ear\".  They are uncomfortable as they press against your ears to your head.  They work for me as I just use them for a break occasionally from my earbuds.  Sound quality is less than average but I don't expect Beats or Bose for $20.  If you do, keep looking.  They work fine for what I need.","Three Stars. Got broken so easy, the quality is too bad but the sound quality is so good. It's okay.","Pretty good. Break after about a year.. The sound and build are decent for the price.

I have bought three of these so far. air used the first pair while cutting lawn. No noise cancelling, so not ideal. Sound ok and par for price. Durable. Battery lasted entire season without a charge. I was very surprised. We lost first pair when we went on a family trip, so I quickly replaced without hesitation with same product.","Great Product!!. I love these headphones!  The bass is great and the sound qualitythey produce is great.  The battery life is good, and the bluetooth capability works well.  It connected to my android tablet without a problem.  These heaphones are well worth $35, and if I ever need a second pair, I would definitely buy tthem again.  It also shipped pretty fast.","Good quality sound. Good quality sound.

The headphones are great, they have a SD Card slot so you can listen to your favorite songs, FM radio and really good sound. The only thing i don't like is the size of it and the way it goes on my head, the curve it has between the headphones and the head band makes my ears hurt.","Bluedio. These headphones are good for the price. The sound quality is not as good as expensive headphones but they work well. The battery life on them is extremely good and I can use them for a long time before having to charge. I do not listen to headphones very often but they are great to have at a good price.","These are decent for the price.. These are decent for the price.

The bluetooth pairing functionality works just fine... but the sound quality is dogs***. I have no idea what good these headphones are, but they're certainly not for listening to music.","Terrible Controls. Sound was good but the multi-function power switch was terrible. The headphones were very hard to simply turn on and off. Each time I turned them back on I had to re-pair them with my TV.  I returned them after a frustrating week.","What a bargain. I have never heard Beats or Bose headphones, but even if better than Bluedio, it's certainly a case of overkill. These Bluedios are incredible. The bases are so deep and smooth, just perfect. The mids and highs are so clear....WOW.  I just love them and cool looking too. I'm 74 and have Bose on my computer and Sony surround sound on my Smart 4k TV so I know good sound. These bluedio headphones are an incredible deal---would highly recommend these, especially at this unbelievable price.....","Very uncomfortable, ear phones do not swivel to cover the ear.. Recommend staying away from these as sound quality is not that good and build quality is not there either, I am returning these for Sony or Panasonic another trusted brand.  I have never seen a person with ears perfectly parallel to each other whIch is the only shape these cans can fit.","Good sound quality. Very good sound quality. \" What you may not notice is that we have adjusted the headband, based on Ergonomics theory, to fit all head sizes.\" But it does not fit my ears, after 15 mins. my ears begin to feel pain. I tried every way to adjust it but it would not work. I guess my ears are too big!\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nUpdate, I opened up the ear pads and cut out the inside pad part. Now they fit over my ears with no problem. Of course this voided the warranty.","good sound and connect by blutooth perfectly. They work very well, good sound and connect by blutooth perfectly.","Excellent Piece - Great Value for Money. The headphones are a little heavy and tight - so if used for an extended period of time, do feel a little tight around the ears. However, for a shorter period of time, they do keep out the noise and the sounds are excellent. The range is also good so much so that at the gym I almost forgot my Galaxy S6 Edge+ on the elliptical. The reduction of one star was because of the tightness. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.","very good!. Good headphones, some windy sound when not playing\/pausing, but still buying another one right now!","Two Stars. Too small for adult ears but sounds very good.","they are just as good quality and sound better than other headphones that cost .... I was not a believer till I bit the bullet and ordered these...they are just as good quality and sound better than other headphones that cost hundreds of dollars.

The headphones feel cheap. Ie: fake chrome plastic etc. But in reality what should I expect for $29.00 dollars?\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe sound is fair, slightly muffled. Treble is almost non existent. Honestly if you use the headphones for 6 months on a regular basis something is going to snap off and\/pr stop working.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe good news is, where as can you find full featured headphones with decent sound for $29.00 dollars? There almost free.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGreat disposable headphones!","Not bad. Not a bad bluetooth headset for the price. They are VERY bass heavy without equalization but when I adjusted the equalization via an app they sound quite good.","Very pleased with them. Very pleased with them.

Good sound, great battery life can go all week without charging, build quality could use improvements however. The head band has a plastic core and it snapped on me near the left ear piece. I tried to repair but it didn't hold. On the plus side they are cheap enough to replace compared to the more expensive sets. The fit was ok, not perfect. For $30 its a good value but don't expect it to hold up to much punishment.","So many great features for iphone users!. I bought these for my sister as a present. They are AMAZING! She loves them. The sound quality is good. Bass is great. AND she can press a button on them and talk to siri on her iphone. As a result, she can control the iphone while it is in her pocket.

Great headset for the price.\r\r\r\nBluetooth works on my laptop (Lenovo T530) and mobile devices (iphone6 & Note4).\r\r\r\nIt is not noise cancelling, but when listening to music its pretty hard to hear others conversations and background noise.\r\r\r\nAlso, its been about 3 weeks since the last charge and so far the battery has lasted and is still at 70% left.\r\r\r\nPlus mic does work pretty good!","ok blue-tooth headset. Sound Quality is OK. Got these on sale for around $25-30. I seen they were originally $100.. Ive found these same headphones regularly priced on GEEK app on my Android cell phone at $28 so I think the $100 price tag is bogus. ,\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nVERY easy Bluetooth set-up\r\r\r\nPretty comfortable to wear.\r\r\r\nUSB charger only cable(NO wall outlet) so be prepared for that (I used my SAMSUNG note5 charger and it works great)","Low price, high quality..

Great value for the money. Everything - including the mic when paired with an iPhone - works great!","Worth more than its being sold for.. Better than Beats. I have had a set since December and decided that I liked them so much I had to buy a set for my wife and daughter. They last for ever in a charge don't know what the spec is but it gives it no justice. Sound quality is great and works as a head set so you can talk with it as well. I'm a simple guy and like a simple review this product works flawlessly","Not Beats but not bad.. Works great, works as a Bluetooth when you call some one. My son likes them.","Worth every single penny!!!! Will not regret!.

Fits my head weird, but works great.  I'm willing to accept that the head thing could be on me.  I do have a notoriously large head.  The important thing is that the item works as advertised.  I do get an odd message on my smartphone, telling me that the headphones are down to about 8 or 9% power despite being fully charged, but that hasn't impeded performance at all."]},{"ngram":"long time","count":13,"ngram_comments":["but i'm sure it can handle it easily. sound is good. takes about 2 hours to charge, then lasts for a long long long time, i haven't tried going over 20 hours, but i'm sure it can handle it easily. sound is good, volume is good, the notification voice is very seductive, which is a plus. only thing is that its not exactly over the ear padding, so large eared people keep that in mind. but for the price, you honestly can't beat it.","Worth the price.

These headphones are good for the price. The sound quality is not as good as expensive headphones but they work well. The battery life on them is extremely good and I can use them for a long time before having to charge. I do not listen to headphones very often but they are great to have at a good price.","Good. They're good. Easy to use and battery lasts a long time.  You get what you'd expect for music quality. It's ok.  One of the  between these and really nice ones is these hurt my head after wearing them for more the 30 mins.  Good entry level ones that don't break the bank.","Great for PC\/Gaming\/TV. Great value\/price. Good, but not great for music.. These are great for the price. I got them on a Lightning deal for $24.  I would buy them again.\r\r\r\nThey are a bit heavier than expected, so not as comfortable wearing them around the house all day.\r\r\r\nI use them occasionally, but after dropping hundreds on Beats Studio's (mostly marketing $$) I can see the short comings of the Bluedio.\r\r\r\nAt 1\/10th the price of wireless Beats, I would have been quite happy to work with these for a long time.","Great headphones they sound awesome but they could fit better.

Pros: Worked great for about 3 weeks\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCons:  After charging them for the second time, they no longer turn on.  LED charging light comes on, but the headphones do not turn on.  This is the second pair of faulty Bluedio headphones I have ordered from Amazon.  The first were DOA.  Cannot find customer support from Bluedio anywhere.  I guess there is a reason why these headphones are so cheap.","Save your money. Was delivered in what looked like perfect condition. Broke the box seal, opened up and plugged in to charge. After charging for a couple hours I unplugged, held the power button down for a few seconds, then again a little longer and a little longer the next time. It never would turn on so they got sent back. I tried them on before sending them back also, they seemed to be constructed for people with huge heads. I have a big head and these were looser than a $.25 \"lady\" working the street corner.","Have had for a long time and the work great. I'm careful with them and have not broken.

These headphones make it easy to listen to my music when others in the house may what to watch TV or read. They are well made and I'm sure I will get years of use out of them.

These guys pair with my transmitter quickly and the sound quality is great. They are comfortable to wear and the controls are easy to access. However, they are cheap.
